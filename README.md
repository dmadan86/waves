# Waves

**Split the bill, settle up, move on.** An expense-splitting app for people
everywhere: unlimited free ledger, link-based guest joining, multi-currency from
the first expense, deep-link settlement with partial and per-expense payments
(UPI in India, PayPal / PayID and more worldwide), and AI receipt itemization
that is free within a monthly scan quota (metered beyond it, since each scan has
a real API cost — see ADR-008).

**Built for a global audience.** India is the first launch market — so the
settlement rails, receipt scripts and pricing lead there — but nothing in the
ledger, currency handling or growth loop is India-only. Every amount is stored
in ISO-4217 minor units from M0, and opening a new market is a settlement rail
and a price tier, not a rewrite.

The two binding specs live in this repo: [`waves-adr.md`](./waves-adr.md) (14
accepted architecture decisions) and [`waves-tdr.md`](./waves-tdr.md) (how to
build them, milestone by milestone). **The ADRs are constraints, not
suggestions** — if code and ADR disagree, the ADR wins.

Current state, as of 2026-08-09. [TDR §10](./waves-tdr.md) carries the evidence
for each line; this is the summary.

| Milestone               | State                                                                                 |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| M0 Foundations          | Complete                                                                              |
| M1 Core ledger          | Complete, verified against the live project                                           |
| M2 Offline sync         | Built — SQLite mirror, mutation queue, `/sync`, draft autosave                        |
| M3 Growth loop          | **Complete.** 56 live checks across three harnesses, all against the deployed project |
| M4 UPI + notifications  | **Not complete**, and the shortfall is bigger than the ✓ suggests — see below         |
| M5 AI receipts + export | **Complete.** All four parts of the criterion have a proof behind them                |

M4 is the largest incomplete block. The settle/confirm state machine, the 7-day
auto-confirm, trip nudges, disputes, the push fan-out and — since 2026-08-09 —
the email half are all built and tested against a real database. What is
missing is that none of it has reached anybody:

- **No push has ever reached a device.** Android's half of the credentials was
  finished on 2026-08-09 — Firebase project `baaki-43455`, its service account
  key uploaded to EAS, and that key proved live against FCM v1 rather than
  assumed to be. iOS still has no APNs key at all. And no build has yet been made
  that contains `google-services.json`, so no phone has been able to ask for a
  token, which is what reaching a device would take.
- **No email has ever been sent.** The pipeline, the suppression list, the
  webhook and the one-click unsubscribe are built and covered by 79 tests, but
  every one of them stops at the edge of the network. Sending needs
  `wavs.co.in` (verified in Resend on 2026-09-07), `RESEND_API_KEY` set as an
  edge secret, a webhook secret, and a deploy.

Also outstanding: `account-delete`. The erasure RPC removes a person's ledger
rows and their auth identity survives it, which needs an edge function holding
the service key.

## Layout

```
apps/mobile/       Expo (SDK 57, React 19, Expo Router, TypeScript strict)
packages/core/     Pure money/split/balance/simplify/settlement logic — no deps
packages/db/       Prisma schema + migrations (RLS, triggers, derived balances)
packages/ui/       Design tokens and components
supabase/          Local stack config + edge functions (M2+)
e2e/               Maestro flows
```

`packages/core` has **zero runtime dependencies** on React or Supabase. That is
deliberate: the app, the guest web view and the Deno edge functions all import
the same module, so three runtimes can never disagree about what someone owes.

## Getting started

```bash
pnpm install

# money engine: 51 tests, property-based
pnpm test:core

# database: throwaway Postgres, migrations, RLS + invariant tests
pnpm db:pg:up
cp .env.example packages/db/.env      # defaults already point at the container
pnpm db:migrate
pnpm test:db
```

Requires Node 24+, pnpm 11+, and Docker.

### Scheduled jobs

Both run hourly under `pg_cron`, take their clock as an argument so they can be
tested without waiting a week, and are idempotent — `notifications.dedupe_key`
is what makes a retried run a no-op rather than a second buzz.

| Job                                | What it resolves                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `waves_auto_confirm_settlements()` | A settlement nobody answered for 7 days (ADR-007). A dispute still reopens it.                                                                                                                               |
| `waves_claim_push_notifications()` | Hands unsent inbox rows to the fanout. An UPDATE, not a SELECT — two overlapping runs cannot both send the same reminder.                                                                                    |
| `waves_trip_nudges()`              | Twice a day during a group's dates: at breakfast about yesterday, at the end of the day about today. Skips anybody who already recorded that day, and asks in the group's timezone rather than the server's. |

### Edge functions

| Function            | What it owns                                                                   |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `sync`              | Batch mutation replay and the change feed (TDR §4)                             |
| `expense-write`     | Recomputes every share with `@waves/core` and writes the expense atomically    |
| `invite-mint`       | Signed, expiring, revocable invite links (only a hash is stored)               |
| `invite-accept`     | Preview without an account, join, and asking to claim a ghost                  |
| `receipt-parse`     | Vision-model itemization, metered against the monthly quota                    |
| `fx-rate`           | One upstream rate, cached, never an open proxy                                 |
| `export-data`       | Lossless JSON and CSV export                                                   |
| `notify-fanout`     | Claims unsent inbox rows, pushes them via Expo and mails the few that merit it |
| `email-events`      | Resend's delivery reports, signature-checked; bounces and complaints suppress  |
| `email-unsubscribe` | One click, no account, signed address (RFC 8058)                               |

`email-events` and `email-unsubscribe` are the only two functions that do not
verify a Supabase JWT, because neither caller can hold one — Resend has no
account, and a mail client pressing "unsubscribe" has no session. Both are named
in `supabase/config.toml`; what stands in for the JWT is a Svix signature over
the webhook body and an HMAC over the address.

All of them except those two and `notify-fanout` — which refuses anything that is
not the service role — take a rate limit before doing the expensive or revealing part of
their work. The allowances live in `supabase/functions/_shared/rateLimit.ts` and
are counted in Postgres, because Supabase discards edge isolates between
requests and a counter held in one limits nothing. `invite-accept` is the reason
the file exists: its preview answers before anybody signs in, which makes it an
oracle for guessing invite tokens, and it is the one bucket keyed on the client
address rather than on a profile.

### Running the full stack

The app talks to Supabase, so it needs the local stack rather than the bare
Postgres container above:

```bash
pnpm supabase:start                  # Postgres + Auth + PostgREST + Realtime + Edge runtime
pnpm db:migrate                      # point DIRECT_URL at the stack's db port first (54322)
pnpm edge:build                      # bundles @waves/core for the Deno runtime
pnpm edge:serve                      # serves supabase/functions locally

# apps/mobile/.env — take the values printed by `supabase start`
#   EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:54321
#   EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<anon key>
pnpm mobile
```

`supabase start` pulls ~10 container images the first time; on a slow or
proxied network that can take a while. To work against a hosted project
instead, point `packages/db/.env` at it and deploy the functions with
`pnpm edge:deploy`.

### Acceptance runs

These talk to a real Supabase project and are the reason M1 is called done:

```bash
ANON_KEY=... SERVICE_KEY=... node e2e/m1-acceptance.mjs   # 26 checks
ANON_KEY=... SERVICE_KEY=... node e2e/m3-invites.mjs      # 20 checks
```

## The invariants

These are the product promise, so they are tests, and CI blocks a merge if any
of them break:

| Invariant                                              | Where                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Σ shares === expense total, for every split type       | `packages/core/test/split.property.test.ts`    |
| Σ balances === 0, per group per currency               | `packages/core/test/balances.property.test.ts` |
| Simplification never changes anyone's net position     | `packages/core/test/simplify.property.test.ts` |
| FX conversions are exactly reproducible                | `packages/core/test/money.test.ts`             |
| Stored balances === the ground-truth aggregate         | `packages/db/test/invariants.test.ts`          |
| Non-members can read nothing; guests only their group  | `packages/db/test/rls.test.ts`                 |
| Expense history cannot be rewritten or hard-deleted    | `packages/db/test/invariants.test.ts`          |
| Only a group member can create, delete or settle in it | `packages/db/test/m1-rpcs.test.ts`             |
| Only the payee can confirm a settlement                | `packages/db/test/m1-rpcs.test.ts`             |
| Replaying a mutation id never double-posts             | `packages/db/test/m1-rpcs.test.ts`             |
| A crash report carries no ledger                       | `apps/web-lite/test/reporting.test.ts`         |

The client also recomputes each group's balances with `@waves/core` and compares
them against the server's `group_balances`. If they ever disagree, the group
screen says so rather than showing a number that might be wrong.

## Crash reporting

Sentry, on all three surfaces — the app, the guest web view and the edge
functions. TDR §11 asks for crash-free sessions above 99.5%, and a 500 from an
edge function is otherwise a line in a log nobody reads.

Everything reported goes through `scrub` in
`packages/core/src/observability/scrub.ts` first. One policy, shared by all
three, because a crash report from an expense splitter would otherwise carry
who ate with whom, the number they were invited on, and the handle they pay
from. What survives is the diagnosis: amounts, ids, stack frames, and the
platform it happened on.

It has a limit and the limit is written down: the scrubber catches shapes
(emails, numbers, UPI handles, tokens) and known fields. A bare name under a key
nobody anticipated matches nothing. So the rule for anything that reports an
error is **attach ids, never rows**.

Nothing is reported unless a DSN is set, so a clone with no Sentry account
builds and runs unchanged:

| Variable                        | Where                      | What it does                                     |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN`        | `apps/mobile/.env`         | turns reporting on in the app                    |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN`        | `apps/web-lite/.env.local` | same, for the guest view                         |
| `SENTRY_DSN`                    | edge function env          | same, for the functions                          |
| `SENTRY_ORG` / `SENTRY_PROJECT` | build env                  | adds source-map upload; without them, minified   |
| `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`             | build env only             | write token — never in a bundle, never committed |

A DSN is public by design: it can only write events, which is why it ships in
the binary. `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` is the one that reads, and it stays in CI.

## Saying the note instead of typing it

The mic beside "What was it for?" is the platform's own recogniser —
`SFSpeechRecognizer` on iOS, `SpeechRecognizer` on Android, via
`expo-speech-recognition`. On-device whenever the phone has a model for the
language, so what somebody says across a restaurant table is not sent anywhere;
where it has none, the OS falls back to the same network recogniser its own
keyboard mic uses.

Three decisions worth knowing:

- **It recognises in the language the app is showing**, and keeps the phone's
  own region when the two agree — `en-GB` stays `en-GB`, a bare `ta` becomes
  `ta-IN`. `speechLocale` in `apps/mobile/src/lib/dictation.ts`.
- **Member names are passed as `contextualStrings`.** A general model guesses at
  Indian names and gets them wrong, and the note is where they turn up.
- **Dictation adds to the field, never replaces it.** Interim results arrive in
  full each time, so the text is recomputed from what was there when the mic was
  tapped rather than appended — `mergeTranscript`, and the test that pins it.

Native module, so it needs a new dev build or store build: `npx expo prebuild`
then `eas build`. The mic does not render on web, and an existing binary will
not grow it from an over-the-air change.

That last point cost an app launch once. `requireNativeModule` throws at the
top of the module's own file, and expo-router loads every route file to build
the route tree — so on a binary that predates the module, the throw is not a
missing microphone, it is a red screen at launch naming a screen nobody had
opened. The import therefore lives in `DictateVoice.tsx` and is reached from
`DictateButton.tsx` through a `require` inside a `try`. **Any native module
added from here on wants the same treatment**, unless every binary that will
ever run the bundle is guaranteed to contain it.

## Scanning the bill instead of typing it

The camera on the add-expense screen is the platform's document scanner —
`VNDocumentCameraViewController` on iOS, ML Kit's document scanner on Android,
via `react-native-document-scanner-plugin`. It finds the page edges and
corrects the perspective, which matters more than it sounds: what follows is
OCR, and OCR reads characters without knowing which ones are on the receipt. A
flat crop of the bill is a different proposition from a photograph of a table.

Capture is one function, `captureReceipt` in `apps/mobile/src/lib/image.ts`,
used by both the add-expense screen and Split by item. It falls back to the
plain camera on a build with no scanner, so the screen asking for a receipt
never has to know which one it got.

What a scan does depends on where it was started:

- **Add expense** takes the grand total and the merchant's name, and leaves the
  splitting alone. Most bills are split some way that has nothing to do with
  what each line cost, and dropping somebody into claiming items because they
  photographed a bill would be worse than letting them type a total.
- **Split by item** fills the lines, as it always has.

A scan started on one and finished on the other is not re-taken. The parsed
receipt is handed over through the draft store — `apps/mobile/src/lib/handover.ts`
— keyed per group, consumed once, cleared immediately, and ignored after ten
minutes. A scan costs the group one of its free scans (ADR-011), so asking for
the same bill twice is a real cost; a receipt left lying in the store to
pre-fill somebody's screen days later is a real bug.

Native module, so it needs `npx expo prebuild` and a new build, and it gets the
lazy-require treatment described above — `TurboModuleRegistry.get` answers
"is it in this binary" without throwing, and the package is only required once
the answer is yes.

### Building it natively

```bash
cd apps/mobile
npx expo prebuild --platform android    # ios needs macOS; Expo refuses on Windows
cd android && ./gradlew assembleDebug -PreactNativeArchitectures=arm64-v8a
```

Needs JDK 17, and an Android SDK with `platform-tools`, `platforms;android-36`
and `build-tools;36.0.0`. The APK lands in
`android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/`.

Two things in this repo exist only because of pnpm, and both fail in ways that
name a file nobody here wrote:

- **`plugins/withShortNativeBuildPath.js`** moves the CMake staging directory to
  `C:\cxx\<module>` on Windows. Five dependencies compile C++, and CMake refuses
  an object path over 250 characters — pnpm's store spends 192 of them before
  the object is named. What you see is not a path error: ninja regenerates its
  manifest in a loop and dies with `manifest 'build.ninja' still dirty after 100
tries`, ten minutes in, blaming `react-native-screens`. Windows long paths do
  not help; the limit is CMake's.
- **`packageExtensions`** in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` declares
  `@expo/config-plugins` for `react-native-document-scanner-plugin`, whose
  config plugin requires it without depending on it. Always present under npm's
  flat layout; absent under pnpm's, where the build dies in
  `expo-constants:createExpoConfig`.

## Where the money went

The Spending screen (`group/[id]/insights`) draws two charts over
`waves_group_spending(group_id)` — what each category cost, and month by month,
for the whole group or for you alone. The function returns the finest grain it
can (member × category × month × currency) and the screen adds up whichever way
it is being asked; summing server-side would answer only one of the two
questions.

Three things it will not do, all of them inherited from the ledger:

- **No currency conversion.** An expense carries the rate that was used
  (ADR-003). Multiplying it out for a chart would print a rounded,
  unreproducible number next to exact ones, so each currency gets its own
  section.
- **No re-dividing.** The per-person figures are the shares the ledger stored,
  odd paisa and all.
- **No history.** Only the current version of a live expense counts, the same
  rule the balances use.

The category comes from a guess, not a menu: `guessCategory` in
`packages/core/src/category` matches whole tokens against an India-first keyword
table — auto, chai, Swiggy, Zepto, IRCTC, kirana — and the chip it picks can be
changed with one tap. Whole tokens, never substrings: `ola` is a cab company and
also the middle of "chocolate". The guess stops the moment somebody taps a chip,
and opening an old expense never re-guesses.

The charts are plain views, not victory-native. That library renders through
Skia now, which is another native module and another prebuild, to animate a list
of bars and a row of columns.

## Taking your ledger elsewhere, and bringing it back

Export is JSON (lossless) or CSV, for one group or all of them, free forever
(ADR-012). The import screen reads three things: a Splitwise CSV, and Waves's own
JSON export, through one RPC — `waves_import_ledger`, of which
`waves_import_splitwise` is now a thin wrapper.

What comes back from our own file is every balance, to the paisa, in every
currency, settlements included. What does not: ids, edit history, and settlement
allocations. None of the three changes what anybody owes, and the screen says so
in those words before the import runs. `packages/db/test/m5-import-export.test.ts`
proves the round trip against a real database rather than in the abstract.

## Backing the personal ledger up to Drive

The "Me" tab — solo expenses, income, recurring rules, loans, budgets — can be
copied to the person's **own** Google Drive, WhatsApp-style: back up now, an
Off/Daily/Weekly/Monthly schedule, Wi‑Fi-only or Wi‑Fi-and-data, a "last backup"
line, and a restore for the new phone. `apps/mobile/src/app/settings/backup.tsx`
is the screen; `apps/mobile/src/lib/backup` is the machinery and
`apps/mobile/src/lib/cloud` is the provider seam it sits on.

Three decisions worth knowing:

- **The narrowest scope Google offers.** `drive.appdata`, not `drive.file` and
  never full `drive`. The backup lives in the hidden per-application folder: the
  app cannot see, list or read anything else in the user's Drive, because the
  token was never issued for it. The file does not appear in their Drive either
  — Drive's storage settings are where they can see and delete it.

- **The key is the user's, and only the user's.** The file is sealed with
  XChaCha20-Poly1305 under a 256-bit key the app generates and shows once as 64
  hexadecimal characters, the same `seal`/`open` the offline mirror uses. It is
  kept in this device's keystore for convenience and typed in on a new phone.
  Waves never sees it and Google holds only ciphertext, so **a lost key is a
  lost backup** — the screen says that before it makes one. The reasoning, and
  the two options rejected, are in the header of
  `apps/mobile/src/lib/backup/recoveryKey.ts`.

- **A restore only adds.** Records carry client-chosen ids that are already the
  idempotency key for `personal.upsert`, so a restore re-queues what this device
  is missing and touches nothing it already has — including things it has
  deleted on purpose. Running it twice does nothing the second time.

- **Everything is per-account, on a phone that is not always one person's.** The
  keystore slots for the Drive tokens and the recovery key, the schedule and
  last-backup preferences, and the remote filename all carry the owner id, and
  signing out wipes the departing account's set (`clearBackupState`, called from
  `clearLocalPrivateData`). The Drive file itself is left alone: it is the
  user's, it is unreadable without their key, and outliving the app's state is
  the whole point of it.

Drive needs **its own OAuth clients**, which the app does not otherwise have:
sign-in goes through Supabase's hosted Google flow and holds no Google client id
of its own. In the Google Cloud console, on a project with the Drive API
enabled: create an OAuth client per platform (Android bound to
`app.waves.mobile` plus the signing SHA-1 — one for debug, one for release; iOS
bound to the bundle id), add `.../auth/drive.appdata` to the consent screen, and
set:

| Variable                                     | Where              | What it does                   |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_DRIVE_CLIENT_ID_ANDROID` | `apps/mobile/.env` | the Android OAuth client       |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_DRIVE_CLIENT_ID_IOS`     | `apps/mobile/.env` | the iOS OAuth client           |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_DRIVE_CLIENT_ID_WEB`     | `apps/mobile/.env` | the fallback for anything else |

These are not secrets — a native OAuth client has none, which is why the flow is
PKCE — but they name a Google project, so they are read from the environment
rather than committed. With none set the app builds and runs; the backup screen
says the destination is unavailable in this build rather than opening a consent
page Google would reject.

A `drive.appdata` app stays in testing until the consent screen is verified;
until then only accounts added as test users can link one.

## Turning on push

Everything between the inbox row and the phone is built and tested — the claim,
the fan-out, the language, the dead-device revocation. The one part that is not
in this repository is the credential that lets a phone have a push token at all,
because it is issued by a console and belongs to whoever owns the app.

The path is Waves → Expo → **FCM** (Android) or **APNs** (iOS) → the phone. Expo
is a relay; the credentials at the far end are still yours to supply.

**Android, once:**

1. Create a Firebase project and add an Android app to it with the package name
   `app.waves.mobile`. It must match, exactly — a mismatch is the error
   `MismatchSenderId` on every notification, months later.
2. Download `google-services.json` and put it at `apps/mobile/google-services.json`.
   It is gitignored: this repository is public, and the file names the Firebase
   project builds get pointed at.
3. Give the same file to EAS, so cloud builds have it too:

   ```bash
   # from apps/mobile. `env:create` still works but is deprecated.
   eas env:set --name GOOGLE_SERVICES_JSON --type file \
     --value ./google-services.json --scope project --visibility secret \
     --environment production --environment preview --environment development
   ```

   Every environment, because a preview build that cannot register for push is
   a preview build that cannot be used to test push.

4. In the Firebase console, under **Project settings → Service accounts**,
   generate a new private key, then hand it to Expo — this is what lets Expo's
   servers send on your behalf:

   ```bash
   eas credentials   # Android → production → Google Service Account → Push Notifications
   ```

   That command is an interactive menu with no flags behind it, so it cannot be
   scripted. The same upload is available on expo.dev under the project's
   credentials, and both end up in the same place: the key is stored on Expo's
   servers, not compiled into anything, and takes effect the moment it lands.

5. Rebuild — for `google-services.json`, which **is** compiled in. An existing
   build has no idea the Firebase project exists, and no service account key
   changes that.

`apps/mobile/app.config.ts` finds the file from the EAS secret or the local copy,
and **leaves the key off entirely when there is neither** — so a checkout without
a Firebase account still builds and runs. What does not work then is registering
for push, and the notifications screen says so in those words rather than sending
somebody to their phone settings over a problem that is ours.

**iOS does not go through Firebase at all.** Expo talks to APNs directly, so
there is no iOS app to add to the Firebase project and no `GoogleService-Info.plist`
this build has any use for. What it needs is an APNs key: a Key with the Apple
Push Notifications service enabled, from the Apple Developer portal, uploaded
with `eas credentials` → iOS → Push Notifications. The `.p8` is downloadable
exactly once.

That needs a paid Apple Developer membership. It does **not** need a Mac — EAS
builds in the cloud and the key comes from a web portal; a Mac is only required
for local builds and the simulator. Not done either way.

**When it is set up and still silent**, read the fanout's reply before suspecting
the phones. It reports `problems` by Expo's error code, and `misconfigured: true`
when those codes are `MismatchSenderId` or `InvalidCredentials` — the two that
mean the credentials are wrong rather than the devices. Without that, a wrong key
looks exactly like a country with its phones switched off: rows go out, failures
climb, and nothing anywhere names the cause.

The service account key can also be tested on its own, with no phone and no
build: sign a JWT with it, exchange that for an OAuth token against
`https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token`, and POST to
`https://fcm.googleapis.com/v1/projects/<project>/messages:send` with
`validate_only: true` and any nonsense string as the device token. A `400
INVALID_ARGUMENT` complaining about the registration token is the answer you
want — it means the key is live, the Firebase Cloud Messaging API is enabled and
the account is allowed to send, and the only thing wrong was the token you made
up. `403 SERVICE_DISABLED` and `403 PERMISSION_DENIED` name a real problem
instead, and name it now rather than after a build and a device.

## Turning on email

Same shape as push: everything between the inbox row and the mailbox is built and
tested, and the part that is not in this repository is the part a console issues.

The pipeline is `notify-fanout` → Resend → `email-events`. Nothing is sent
without a verified sending domain, and nothing is sent at all while
`RESEND_API_KEY` or `EMAIL_UNSUBSCRIBE_SECRET` is unset — the fanout checks for
both before it claims a row, so a half-configured deployment strands nothing.

**In the Resend dashboard, once:**

1. Add the domain **`wavs.co.in`** and publish the SPF, DKIM and DMARC
   records it gives you. Until it says verified, every send is refused outright —
   this is not a deliverability problem that shows up as spam, it is a 4xx.
2. Add a webhook pointing at
   `https://ywojpnfyxxltvihqmcni.supabase.co/functions/v1/email-events`,
   subscribed to `email.delivered`, `email.bounced`, `email.complained` and
   `email.opened`. Copy its signing secret — it starts `whsec_`.

**Then, once:**

```bash
supabase secrets set RESEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
supabase secrets set RESEND_API_KEY=re_...
supabase secrets set EMAIL_FROM='Waves <hello@wavs.co.in>'        # optional; this is the default
supabase secrets set EMAIL_WEB_URL=https://app.wavs.co.in         # optional; this is the default
pnpm edge:deploy
```

`EMAIL_UNSUBSCRIBE_SECRET` is what signs the one-click unsubscribe URL. Changing
it invalidates every unsubscribe link already sitting in somebody's mailbox, so
it is set once and left alone.

`EMAIL_WEB_URL` is where the button in an email points — defaults to the web
app, `https://app.wavs.co.in`, because the button lands on a group page that
only that deployment serves. A fork or a self-host pointing at a
different domain (or nothing at all, deliberately) should set this explicitly;
with it unset the button falls back to the `waves://` deep link,
which works on a phone and does nothing in desktop webmail. That fallback is
deliberate: an `https://` URL that 404s looks like it should have worked.

**What can be seen without sending anything:** `email_status` on `notifications`
tells you what happened to each one — `suppressed` means we chose not to mail it
(no confirmed address, email turned off, or the address is on the suppression
list), `failed` means Resend refused it, and NULL after a run means it will be
retried. `email_events` is the trail, one row per send plus one per report.

## Sign in with Apple

Back, and live since 2026-09-05. This section previously said it had been
removed; that was true for a while and stopped being true when the entitlement,
`expo-apple-authentication` and the native sheet came back. App Store guideline
4.8 is why it is not optional: an app offering a third-party social login must
offer an equivalent private one, and this app offers Google.

Two audiences share one Supabase provider, and **the order they are listed in is
load-bearing**:

```
app.wavs.web,app.wavs.mobile
```

GoTrue accepts every id here as a valid audience when it verifies an identity
token, but it sends only the **first** to Apple as `client_id` when it starts a
browser round trip. A bundle id is not a valid web client. Put it first and
Apple answers `invalid_request` on every Android and web sign-in while native
iOS keeps working — which looks like a platform bug rather than like one field
in the wrong order.

So: the Services ID (`app.wavs.web`) first, for the browser fallback used on
Android and web; the bundle id (`app.wavs.mobile`) second, for the iOS
id-token flow.

**The secret expires.** Apple issues no static one — what Supabase stores is an
ES256 JWT signed with the Sign in with Apple `.p8`, and six months is the
maximum lifetime Apple accepts. Apple sign-in fails on the day it lapses and
nothing else does. Regenerating it needs the `.p8`, the Key ID, the Team ID and
the Services ID; the signature must be raw R||S (`dsaEncoding: 'ieee-p1363'` in
Node), because the DER encoding Node produces by default yields a token Apple
rejects as malformed, which reads like a wrong key.

**Testing either provider without a device.** Ask the hosted project for an
authorize URL and follow it:

```bash
curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{redirect_url}\n' \
  "https://<project-ref>.supabase.co/auth/v1/authorize?provider=apple&redirect_to=waves://auth"
```

The `Location` carries the exact `client_id` and `redirect_uri` being sent,
which is what makes a mismatch obvious. Follow it: a working client returns
Apple's full sign-in page, a rejected one a bare shell. The same probe against
`provider=google` returns a plain `Error 400: redirect_uri_mismatch` page when
the console is wrong. Both providers were broken in exactly these two ways on
2026-09-05, and this is how it was found.

## The rename, and what it needs from the consoles

The app was called `baaki` before it was called Waves, and the old name is now
gone from the source, the database, the local stack and these docs. What is left
lives in somebody's console rather than in this repository:

1. **The OAuth redirect.** The app asks for `waves://auth` and registers only
   the `waves` scheme. Add `waves://auth` to the hosted project's **Auth →
   URL Configuration → Redirect URLs**, and to the redirect URIs of the Google
   OAuth client (and Apple's Services ID, if that ever comes back). Until it is
   listed, Google sign-in completes at the provider and lands nowhere.
2. **The three hosts.** The marketing site keeps the apex, `wavs.co.in`; the
   product moved to `app.wavs.co.in` and the console to `admin.wavs.co.in`.
   Point both subdomains at their Vercel projects, and put the console's host in
   `ADMIN_ALLOWED_ORIGIN` — its CSRF check compares against exactly that name.
   The app's invite links and the button in every email now resolve against
   `app.wavs.co.in`, so a join link is dead until that host answers.
3. **The edge functions.** They call `waves_*` now. A deployed function still
   calling the old names answers "function does not exist" on every write, so
   they redeploy with this.
4. **The two app identifiers, which are not the same string.** iOS is
   `app.wavs.mobile` and Android is `app.waves.mobile` — note the spelling.
   `app.waves.mobile` was already registered under somebody else's Apple
   developer account, and Apple bundle ids are globally unique, so the iOS half
   took the product domain's own spelling. Android was left alone: its package
   is what `google-services.json`, the Play listing and every `appId:` in
   `e2e/` key off, and none of them can see the iOS id. Nothing reads across
   the two, so the divergence is harmless — but it is the sort of thing a
   later reader "corrects". Both are right.

The database was **rebuilt, not migrated**. The whole migration history is one
file — `20260904000000_waves_baseline` — that builds the schema already named
`waves_*`, and the hosted database was dropped and recreated from it on
2026-09-04. There is no upgrade path from a database built by the old files and
no compatibility aliases, by choice. Everything the hosted database held went
with it — 152 accounts, 100 groups, 806 expenses, all of it development data —
and a dump was taken first. The three rows in `storage.objects` survived: the
Storage API refuses a direct delete, so those bytes are orphaned until they are
removed through it.

The only thing that keeps its old name is the Firebase project
(`baaki-43455`), because that id was issued by a console and the app is
still registered under it.

An installed app still carries its own device state across the rename. The
device keys and the mirror's SQLite file move on the first launch after the
update (`lib/legacyKeys.ts`, `sync/legacyDatabase.ts`), which keeps the
language, theme, app lock and device identity rather than resetting them. The
mirror itself is of a database that no longer holds those rows, so the first
sync after this is a fresh one either way.

## Releasing, and stopping old builds

The version is compiled into the binary, so a build can only ever describe
itself — it cannot know something newer exists. The policy lives in
`public.app_releases`, one row per store, and the app asks on launch and on
every foreground.

| Column            | Means                                          |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `latest_version`  | what is published — a dismissible banner       |
| `minimum_version` | the oldest build allowed to open — a hard wall |
| `store_url`       | where the Update button goes                   |
| `message`         | optional, replaces the default wall copy       |

Raising them is one statement, and it takes effect on the next foreground with
no app release involved:

```sql
-- a new build is out; nothing is wrong with the old one
UPDATE app_releases SET latest_version = '0.2.0' WHERE platform = 'android';

-- 0.1.x may no longer run: it computed something wrongly
UPDATE app_releases
   SET minimum_version = '0.2.0',
       message = 'Expenses added on the old version split rupees wrongly.'
 WHERE platform = 'android';
```

Only the service role can write it; everybody, including signed-out guests, can
read it, because the check runs before the sign-in screen.

Three things stop a mistake here from bricking every phone:

- A `CHECK` refuses a `minimum_version` above `latest_version` — that row would
  block every build in existence, including the one the Update button installs.
- A `CHECK` refuses a version string the client cannot compare (`v2`, `2.0-rc`),
  which would otherwise silently switch the policy off.
- The client fails towards opening: no answer, an unreadable version, or a
  policy it does not understand all resolve to "carry on". The one exception is
  a policy it has already fetched, which is cached and honoured offline —
  "this build computes money wrongly" does not stop being true when the phone
  loses signal. Every foreground re-checks, so a corrected policy lands as soon
  as there is a connection.

The comparison itself is `compareVersions` in `packages/core/src/version`,
mirrored in SQL by `waves_version_key()` so the database and the app cannot
disagree about which of two versions is newer.

## Money rules

- Amounts are **`BIGINT` minor units** plus an ISO-4217 code. No float, no
  decimal, anywhere (ADR-003).
- Balances are **always derived**, never stored as a mutable running total
  (ADR-004). The Postgres tables are a cache that CI proves equal to the
  aggregate.
- The remainder of an uneven split rotates by expense id, so the same person
  does not always absorb the extra paisa (ADR-009).
- Waves **never moves money**. Settlement opens a UPI intent in the payer's own
  app and records the outcome (ADR-007).

## Monetization guardrail (ADR-011)

Manual expense entry, groups, all split types, balances, settlement recording
and export are **unlimited and free, forever**. No daily caps, no ads in a money
flow. Convenience is what gets monetized: AI scan volume beyond the free quota,
deeper analytics, trip passes, themes. Treat this as a review checklist item.
