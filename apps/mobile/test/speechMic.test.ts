/**
 * Handing the one microphone from one capture to the next.

 * The device bug these are written against is always the same shape: the first
 * utterance is heard and the second one is not. Every case below is a way that
 * used to happen — a previous session's ending closing the new one, a teardown
 * running after the new start and destroying it, two starts issued at once, or a
 * claim nobody ever gave back. None of it can be seen on the emulator (no live
 * mic), so the sequencing is tested here instead of asserted on a device.
