              `Stack.Protected` is not decoration here: when a guard flips from
              true to false, expo-router *removes every history entry* for the
              screens inside it. That is the whole fix for "sign in, land on the
              dashboard, press Android back, and the login screen comes back" —
              a `replace` only swaps the top of the stack, so `welcome` (and
              anything pushed from it) stayed underneath as a back target. With
              the group guarded, a session appearing erases those entries and
              back from the dashboard leaves the app, which is what every other
              app on the phone does.
              It cuts the other way too: signing out drops the whole signed-in
              history, so back cannot walk into a screen the account no longer
              owns.
              This group must stay FIRST — a signed-out person on a guarded app
              screen falls back to the first screen still available, and that
