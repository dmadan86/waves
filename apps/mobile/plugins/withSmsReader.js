/**
 * `READ_SMS` in the manifest — only when a build deliberately asks for it.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A BUILD-TIME SWITCH AND NOT A RUNTIME ONE. Google Play scans the
 * uploaded artefact's merged manifest. A declared `READ_SMS` is a *restricted*
 * permission: holding it without an approved core use case from the Permissions
 * Declaration Form gets an app removed from Play, not merely an update
 * rejected, and "we never actually call it" is not a defence the scanner can
 * hear. A feature flag, however honest, is invisible to it — the permission is
 * either in the binary or it is not. So the Play artefact must not contain it,
 * full stop, and that decision has to be made where the manifest is written.
 *
 * See `docs/plan-drafts-and-rules.md` §1.2 for the policy, and
 * `docs/GOOGLE-PLAY.md` for the same rule in this repo's own words.
 *
 * HOW IT IS TURNED ON. One environment variable, at prebuild time:
 *
 *     WAVES_SMS_READER=1 npx expo prebuild --platform android
 *
 * Anything else — unset, `0`, `true`, `yes` — is off. Exactly one spelling is
 * accepted on purpose: a permission this consequential should never be turned
 * on by a value somebody typed loosely.
 *
 * WHAT "OFF" MEANS, PRECISELY. Off, this plugin registers no mod at all and
 * returns the config object it was handed. It does not add an empty edit, it
 * does not normalise anything, it does not touch `android.permissions`. A
 * default build's `AndroidManifest.xml` is therefore byte-for-byte what it
 * would be with this plugin absent from `app.json` — which is the property
 * `apps/mobile/test/smsReaderPlugin.test.ts` pins, and the one a reviewer
 * should re-check by diffing two prebuilds.
 *
 * The runtime half is separate and *also* mandatory: `src/lib/smsFeature.ts`
 * gates every entry point on the `sms_inbox_read` feature flag and on this
 * build having the permission at all. Two independent gates, neither one
 * standing in for the other.
