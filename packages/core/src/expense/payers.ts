/**
 * Saying who paid, in one place.

 * the whole thing on one of them, in a list somebody reads to remember what
 * happened.
 *
 * This lived in the phone's lib until the browser grew the same screens. The
 * rules are plain functions so the group ledger, the month drill-down and the
 * audit trail cannot drift apart on either client, and so they can be tested
