  /**
   * The other ending: a session that stopped without anybody asking.
   *
   * Note what is *not* here. No `DELETE FROM pending_mutations`, no
   * `DELETE FROM drafts`, and no `destroyKey` — those three lines are the
   * difference between this and `reset`, and each of them would destroy
   * something no other copy of exists. What does go is the mirror and the
   * cursors: the server holds that ledger and will hand it back on the next
   * sign-in, so keeping it on a phone nobody is signed into is cost without
   * benefit.
   *
   * One transaction, for the same reason `reset` is one: the stamp is what
   * makes the surviving queue attributable, and a queue on disk with no stamp
   * beside it is data nobody may adopt. Written together or not at all.
