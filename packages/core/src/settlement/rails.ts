/**
 * How money actually moves, per country.
 *
 * Waves was built UPI-first, and `settle.tsx` said so: `'upi' | 'cash' |
 * 'bank'`, a union of three, one of which does not exist outside India. That is
 * fine for one market and a rewrite for every other one, so the rails are data
 * here instead — a list keyed by country, which makes Brazil a new entry rather
 * than a new screen.
 *
 * **A rail links only where somebody has published a link.**
 *
 * `upi://pay` is a published Android intent that every Indian bank app
 * implements, and it is the reason settling in Waves takes one tap. The danger
 * with a custom scheme is that it fails *silently* when nothing is installed to
 * answer it — a tap that appears to work while no money moves — so `'app'`
 * links are checked with `canOpenURL` before they are offered.
 *
 * An https link is a different thing and is treated differently. `cash.app/
 * $tag/25` and `paypal.me/user/25USD` are public, long-standing URLs whose
 * worst case is a web page, not a lie. Those are `'web'`.
 *
 * Everything else shows the payee's handle to copy, and that is the ordinary
 * case rather than a failure: Pix is a key or a scanned EMV code, not a URL;
 * Zelle and PayID live inside each bank's own app; Venmo's app links are
 * neither documented nor stable. A rail that admits it cannot hand off is more
 * useful than one that pretends it can.
 *
 * Recording the settlement is separate from performing it either way — the
 * ledger has always tracked what people say they paid, confirmed by whoever was
 * paid (ADR-007), and that part is identical in every country.
