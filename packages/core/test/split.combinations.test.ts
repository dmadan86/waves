/**
 * Exhaustive split combinations for the three split types a user picks by hand:
 * **percentage**, **fixed value** (`exact`) and **share** (`shares`).
 *
 * The property suite in `split.property.test.ts` proves the invariants hold for
 * randomly drawn inputs. This one is the opposite approach: a defined space,
 * walked completely, so the same numbers are checked on every run rather than
 * whichever ones fast-check happened to draw. The space is described in
 * `docs/split-scenarios.md`, and it is:
 *
 *   participants  2, 3, 4, 5
 *   amounts       0, 1, 7, 100, 333, 999, 1000, 100000, 123457 paise
 *   weights       every composition of 10 units across the participants
 *                 (11, 66, 286 and 1001 vectors for 2–5 people)
 *
 * That is 1364 weight vectors × 9 amounts × 2 weighted types, plus the fixed
 * value cases derived from each result — roughly 25k computations, all of them
 * checked against the same five rules.
 *
 * Every one of these runs on the server for real: the edge functions recompute
 * shares from `split_params` with this exact function and reject a client whose
 * numbers differ (TDR §4).
