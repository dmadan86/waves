# Edge functions

Deno + TypeScript. Anything that must not run client-side lives here (ADR-002,
ADR-013): invite minting, ghost claim/merge, the AI receipt parse, notification
fanout, exports and the Splitwise import, plus the `/sync` endpoint from TDR §4.

Rules for every function in this directory:

1. **Authorize explicitly.** The service role bypasses RLS, so each function
   checks membership itself before touching a row — `is_group_member()` is the
   same predicate the policies use.
2. **Never trust client-computed money.** Shares are recomputed with
   `@waves/core` and a mismatch is rejected with `SHARE_MISMATCH` (TDR §4).
3. **Secrets only from the function environment** — `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`,
   `RESEND_API_KEY`, `RESEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`.
   Email delivery is provider-agnostic in shape: `EMAIL_PROVIDER` selects
   `resend` (default) or `sendgrid`, and the key it needs is `RESEND_API_KEY` or
   `SENDGRID_API_KEY` accordingly. **`sendgrid` is refused by the mail queues
   today**, by `emailSendable()`, for two reasons that both have to be closed
   first: SendGrid has no idempotency key, so a send whose outcome was never
   learned would be retried and delivered twice; and `email-events` verifies a
   Svix signature while SendGrid signs its Event Webhook with ECDSA, so
   delivery events — and with them the suppression list — would stop.
   Nothing here may ever be referenced from `apps/*`.
4. **Idempotency.** Mutations carry `client_mutation_id`; retries must be safe.
5. **Attach ids, never rows.** Anything falling through to a 500 is sent to
   Sentry (`observability.ts`), scrubbed by `@waves/core`. The scrubber catches
   shapes and known fields — it cannot tell a name from a word — so an error
   message must carry a code and an id, not a description. `HttpError` is never
   reported: a refusal the caller can act on is the function working.
6. **Take a rate limit before doing the expensive or revealing thing.**
   `enforceRateLimit(service, request, bucket, profileId)` from `rateLimit.ts`,
   with the allowance for every bucket in that one file. Placement is the whole
   of it: `invite-accept` counts _before_ the token lookup, because everything
   after that line is the oracle; `fx-rate` counts _after_ the cache, because a
   cache hit reaches no upstream and costs nobody anything.

   A new function is not limited because it exists — add its bucket. The one
   exception is `notify-fanout`, which is not for clients: it refuses anything
   that is not the service role, and rate-limiting our own cron would only ever
   break the cron.

Planned functions, by milestone:

| Function               | Milestone | Purpose                                                 |
| ---------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sync`                 | M2        | Batch mutation replay + change feed (TDR §4)            |
| `invite-mint`          | M3        | Signed, expiring, revocable invite tokens               |
| `ghost-claim`          | M3        | Transactional ghost → real member merge                 |
| ~~`splitwise-import`~~ | M3        | Shipped as `waves_import_splitwise` instead — see below |
| `notify-fanout`        | M4        | Classify → resolve recipients → push/email (TDR §7.1)   |
| `email-events`         | M4        | Resend webhook ingestion + suppression list             |
| `email-unsubscribe`    | M4        | RFC 8058 one-click opt-out (not in the TDR — see below) |
| `receipt-parse`        | M5        | Vision LLM itemization with quota metering              |
| `export`               | M5        | Lossless JSON + locale-aware CSV, signed URL            |

## What each bucket allows

Set so that somebody using the app normally never meets one. The numbers live in
`rateLimit.ts`; this table is here so the shape is reviewable without reading it.

| Bucket          | Allowance    | Counted against | Why that number                                                         |
| --------------- | ------------ | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sync`          | 120 / minute | profile         | The sync engine pushes on every mutation and pulls on every foreground  |
| `expense-write` | 60 / minute  | profile         | Far above any human, well below a script                                |
| `fx-rate`       | 60 / minute  | profile         | Only the calls that miss the cache and reach an upstream                |
| `receipt-parse` | 10 / minute  | profile         | On top of the monthly quota — stops a retry loop spending it in seconds |
| `invite-mint`   | 30 / hour    | profile         | The live-link cap is per group, so somebody in many groups had none     |
| `invite-accept` | 30 / hour    | **IP address**  | Answers before anybody signs in; the reason this exists                 |
| `export-data`   | 10 / hour    | profile         | Reads a whole group and builds a file                                   |

`invite-accept` is keyed on the client address because its preview deliberately
answers before any identity exists (ADR-006) — there is no profile to blame yet.
Everything else is keyed on the profile, so a café full of users behind one NAT
is not treated as one abuser.

## The two functions with no JWT

Every function here verifies a Supabase JWT except `email-events` and
`email-unsubscribe`, which are named in `supabase/config.toml` with
`verify_jwt = false`. Both have callers that cannot possibly hold one:

- **`email-events`** is Resend reporting what happened to a message. What stands
  in for the JWT is a Svix signature over the exact bytes of the body — checked
  before the body is parsed, because a webhook that parses first is one where a
  forged `bounced` event suppresses somebody's mail.
- **`email-unsubscribe`** is a mail client pressing the button Gmail puts beside
  the sender's name, unattended, on behalf of somebody who may not have the app.
  What stands in for the JWT is an HMAC over the address; without it the URL
  would be a bare `?address=` and unsubscribing a stranger would be a matter of
  typing theirs. GET renders a confirmation page and changes nothing — corporate
  scanners follow every link in every message before it is delivered.

`voice-stream` (the live-transcription WebSocket relay) and `otp-send` are the
others. `voice-stream` does verify a Supabase JWT — itself, from the
`jwt-<token>` subprotocol, because a WebSocket upgrade from React Native or a
browser cannot carry an Authorization header for the gateway to check.

If either is ever deployed with the default `verify_jwt = true`, both fail
silently: delivery reports are answered 401 until Resend stops sending them, and
nobody can get off the list.

## What gets emailed, and what never does

The list is in `@waves/core` (`notifications/email.ts`) and again in SQL
(`waves_claim_email_notifications`), and it is four kinds long: settlement
confirmations, the daily digest, and a nudge to somebody with no device. Routine
ledger activity is deliberately absent. Mailing a person every time a flatmate
buys milk is the mistake that teaches them to filter the sender, and after that
the settlement confirmations do not arrive either.

Suppression is checked in SQL before anything reaches this directory: a hard
bounce, a spam complaint or a one-click unsubscribe all land in
`email_suppressions`, and the claim will not hand out a row for an address in it.

## Deviation: the Splitwise import is not a function

TDR §10 puts the import here and asks for a **transactional** insert. Those two
cannot both hold: a function looping over REST writes has no transaction, and a
half-finished import is the failure nobody can see — the balances still add up,
they are simply the balances of a smaller group that never existed.

So the import ships as `waves_import_splitwise`, a single `SECURITY DEFINER`
function in the database. A function body is one transaction, which is the
property §10 was asking for. Parsing stays in `@waves/core` and runs on the
client, so a file that turns out not to be a Splitwise export costs a round trip
to nowhere. TDR §10 wants amending to match.
