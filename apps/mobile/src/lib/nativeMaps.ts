/**
 * A non-throwing gate to the native Google Maps surface.
 *
 * `react-native-maps` is a native module: importing its JS on a binary built
 * before the module was added throws at load, and nothing in React catches it —
 * the app dies at launch (the same trap `expo-speech-recognition` sits behind in
 * `VoiceMicPanel`). So the surface is reached only through this guarded
 * `require`. When the native module is present `nativeMaps` carries the
 * component and its region helper; when it is not — an older build an OTA update
 * reached — it is `null`, and the caller falls back to the raster-tile map.
