 * would be told it has `en-IN` — and asking the recogniser for an on-device
 * model that is not there returns silence (the "did not catch anything" bug).
 * So two *regioned* tags must match in full: `en-US` does not satisfy `en-IN`.
 *
 * A language-only entry is the one wildcard: Android commonly lists an installed
 * model as just `en`, meaning the generic English model, which does cover any
 * region of English. So `en` (installed) covers `en-IN` (wanted), and a bare
 * `en` request is covered by any installed English. Only when both sides name a
