/**
 * Waves design tokens.
 *
 * Derived from the two reference boards: a lavender canvas, white cards with
 * softened corners and one soft shadow, a single saturated purple that owns
 * every primary action and active state, and a pastel family used to tint
 * category and stat cards.
 *
 * Cards sit at `md`. The reference boards are drawn at tablet width, where a
 * 24pt corner reads as a gentle curve; on a phone the same radius eats into a
 * card that is only a few hundred points wide and the panel starts to look
 * like a pill. Pills are for things you tap.
 *
 * Money colour is semantic and global, never decorative: owed-to-you is always
 * the periwinkle/blue pair, you-owe is always the pink/red pair. Nothing else in
 * the app is allowed to use those two colours.
 *
 * The palette is deliberately green-free (and free of blue-green/teal): the
 * brand wears a 2025 neon-indigo/violet, the paired accent a warm sunset coral,
 * owed-money a calm blue, and owed-by-you the raspberry red. "Good" money reads
 * blue rather than green, so nothing on any surface — dashboard included — needs
 * a green.

  // Two inks per pastel. `Ink` is the strong one (~7:1 on its own bg, for
  // titles and amounts); `InkMuted` is the quiet one (~4.6:1, for the subtitle
  // line under it). Both clear WCAG AA — the old single ink was faded with
  // `opacity: 0.7` for subtitles, which dropped every pastel below 3:1.
  // Pink and coral sit on very light bgs, so a title dark enough for AA plus a
  // lighter muted below it forced the ink almost to black — a harsh blood-red.
  // These two take one friendly ink instead (a dusty berry / a terracotta):
  // both clear AA on their bg, and the subtitle separates from the title by
  // weight, not by going darker. `InkMuted` mirrors `Ink` so callers are
  // unchanged. The warmer hue is drawn from the raspberry/coral reference.
