/**
 * What a personal-ledger backup actually *is*, and how a restore folds one back
 * in. Pure — no keystore, no network, no React — so every decision in here is
 * unit-testable, and the parts that are not pure (the key, the upload) have
 * nothing left in them worth arguing about.
 *
 * The backed-up thing is the raw `personal_records` rows for the signed-in
 * owner, exactly as the mirror materialises them (server rows plus the offline
 * queue replayed on top, per ADR-005). Not the decoded `PersonalTxn`/`Loan`
 * shapes the screens use: those are one lossy interpretation of the blob, and a
 * backup that only understands today's fields cannot restore tomorrow's. The
 * `data` blob is opaque here for the same reason it is opaque to the server.
 *
 * A restore is deliberately additive. Every record carries a client-chosen id
 * that is already the idempotency key for `personal.upsert`, so a record the
 * device already has is skipped and a record it is missing is re-queued — no
 * merge, no field-level resolution, no clobbering something newer with an older
 * copy. That makes the two cases people actually hit correct: a fresh install
 * (nothing local, everything comes back) and a partial loss (only the missing
 * rows return). It also means a restore can be run twice with no second effect.
 *
 * Tombstones ride along but are never re-applied. A backup that could delete
 * records on restore is a backup that can lose data, and the whole point of the
 * file is that it cannot.
