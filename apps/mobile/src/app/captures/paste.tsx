/**
 * Bank messages into drafts.
 *
 * This is the SMS feature, and on an iPhone it is the whole of it. iOS has no
 * API that reads Messages at any tier, and Android's `READ_SMS` is restricted —
 * held without an approved core use case it is grounds for removal from Play,
 * not a rejected update (`docs/plan-drafts-and-rules.md` §1). So the honest
 * design is the one where a person hands the messages over, and it is complete
 * on its own rather than a fallback for a reader that is not there.
 *
 * A build made with `WAVES_SMS_READER=1`, on Android, for somebody in the
 * `sms_inbox_read` treatment arm, gets one extra button here: it leads to a
 * disclosure screen (`./messages`), never straight to the system prompt.
 * Everything downstream of that button — the found list, the ticking, the
 * writing — is this screen, unchanged.
 *
 * WHO THIS IS FOR. Somebody who has never used an expense app, and may never
 * have deliberately copied text on a phone before. Everything on the screen is
 * measured against that: no codes, no jargon, no rule about blank lines to get
 * wrong, and never a guess dressed up as a fact.
 *
 * - The sender is a telecom routing header (`JM-ICICIT-S`), so it is turned
 *   into "ICICI Bank" by `lib/smsPlain.ts` — and when that table does not know
 *   the id, the line is simply not there. A code on screen is worse than a
 *   blank.
 * - A merchant that is plainly not a name — a phone number, a bare "VPA" —
 *   does not become the title. "Payment from Axis Bank" is less specific and
 *   entirely true, which is the trade this screen always makes.
 * - A row the parser was unsure of says *what* it was unsure of, in a sentence,
 *   and every pasted row can be opened to read the message it was made from.
 *   "Check this" with nothing to check against is not a warning, it is a worry.
 *
 * WHERE THINGS GO. Each ticked payment becomes a `captures` row: an expense
 * with no group yet, which is what the Review tab has held since A34. Not a
 * second inbox (#565 undid that once already), not an expense in a group —
 * nothing here knows who was there, and the parser deliberately does not guess
 * at a split.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT SENT. Parsing is on-device (ADR-013): a bank message carries an
 * account tail, a balance and sometimes a one-time password. The text of a
 * pasted message rides along as `rawText` the way a scanned receipt's OCR does
 * — a person put it there themselves. The text of a *read* message never does;
 * `lib/smsDrafts.ts` is where that is decided, and a test pins it. The same
 * function decides what may be *shown*, so the message a person can open on a
 * row is exactly the message that will be kept, and a read one is neither. And
 * nothing on this screen reports anything at all: no Sentry event, no Clarity
 * event, not even a count. A paste that parses badly is said to the person in
 * front of it, and to nobody else.
 *
 * WHY IT IS A FLASHLIST. A month of statements is a hundred rows, and this is
 * the screen the plan points the backfill at. The paste box and the intro ride
 * as the list header so there is one scroll region rather than a list nested in
 * a ScrollView, which does not virtualise at all.
