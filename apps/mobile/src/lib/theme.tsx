/**
 * Light or dark, and the switch for it.

 * Three states, not two: light, dark, and "whatever the phone says". The third
 * is the default and matters most — somebody who has told their phone to go
 * dark at sunset should not have to tell every app separately, and the design
 * ships a full dark palette (tokens.ts) precisely so following that setting
 * costs nothing.
 *
 * The chosen scheme is fed to `@waves/ui`'s `ThemeProvider` as `forceScheme`;
 * a null preference leaves `forceScheme` undefined, so the design system falls
 * back to the OS scheme on its own.
