/**
 * Deciding how somebody signs in — and, more importantly, how they stop being
 * a guest without losing everything.
 *
 * ADR-006 says an anonymous account is upgraded **in place**. That one
 * sentence is the whole reason this file exists, because the obvious code does
 * the opposite: a guest taps "sign in with Google", the app calls
 * `signInWithOAuth`, Supabase creates a *new* user, the session swaps, and the
 * trip they have been adding expenses to all week now belongs to an account
 * they can no longer reach. Nothing errors. The group is not deleted — it is
 * simply somebody else's, and the only way back is the anonymous session that
 * was just replaced.
 *
 * So the choice of call is not left to whichever screen is asking. Given who
 * is signed in and what they picked, `planAuth` returns the one correct
 * action, and the screens do as they are told. It is pure, so the case that
 * matters — a guest with data — can be tested without an account, a network,
 * or a phone.
 *
 * Nothing here talks to Supabase. It decides; the caller performs.
