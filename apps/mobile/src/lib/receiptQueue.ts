/**
 * Every receipt an expense gains goes through here (ADR-005 for images).
 *
 * Adding a receipt used to be two different things depending on the weather:
 * online it was upload → RPC → done, driven by a mutation living on the expense
 * screen; offline the capture was parked on the device and sent on reconnect.
 * The online half had three problems the person could feel. Nothing appeared
 * while the bytes were in the air, so there was no way to tell a slow upload
 * from one that had quietly failed. Walking away from the screen took the
 * mutation's callbacks with it. And an app killed mid-upload lost the photograph
 * outright — it only ever existed in memory and in the picker's cache.
 *
 * So there is one path now, the durable one: a picked image is written to a file
 * and recorded in a queue *before* anything is sent, and the queue is what
 * uploads it. The gallery shows the capture from its local file the instant it
 * is parked, wearing the state it is actually in — waiting, sending, or not
 * sent — and a flush that finishes while the person is three screens away still
 * lands. Nothing about that is tied to a component being mounted.
 *
 * The queue index lives in AsyncStorage (small, structured); the image bytes
 * live under the OS *document* directory — not the cache — because a pending
 * upload is unsent data the OS must not reclaim, unlike the view cache which it
 * may. A flushed capture's bytes move into the view cache and out of here.
 *
 * The entry's `attachmentId` is the eventual row id, chosen up front, so the
 * optimistic gallery item and the real row that arrives after the flush share
 * one identity — the gallery de-dupes on it, and a retry never doubles a row.
 *
 * Views subscribe rather than poll: the queue publishes a snapshot on every
 * change (parked, sending, sent, failed) through `usePendingReceipts`, the same
 * `useSyncExternalStore` shape `transferProgress` uses, because the work that
 * changes it happens in plain library code with no React around it.
