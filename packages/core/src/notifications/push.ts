/**
 * Turning inbox rows into Expo push messages, and reading back what happened.
 *
 * The sending itself is four lines of `fetch` in an edge function. Everything
 * that can actually be got wrong is here, where it can be tested without a
 * network or a phone:
 *
 *   * **Fan-out.** One notification with three devices is three messages, and
 *     the reply comes back as one flat array in send order. Losing track of
 *     which ticket belongs to which token is how a dead device gets a live
 *     token revoked.
 *   * **Language.** The row was written by Postgres, which had no idea who
 *     would read it. A push says the same thing as the inbox, in the same
 *     language, because it is the same notification.
 *   * **Dead tokens.** Expo answers `DeviceNotRegistered` for an app that was
 *     uninstalled. Not revoking those means paying to fail forever; revoking
 *     the wrong one means somebody silently stops getting notifications.
 *
 * Expo takes at most 100 messages per request, so the chunking lives here too.
