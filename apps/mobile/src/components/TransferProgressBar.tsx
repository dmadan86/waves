/**
 * A slim progress bar across the top of the app while transfers run — the
 * browser's page-load / download bar, for receipt uploads (and any future
 * transfer that reports through {@link useTransferProgress}).
 *
 * It is behind the `upload_progress` feature flag, so it can be turned on or off
 * from the console without a ship. Off (or outside the rollout) it renders
 * nothing; the transfer store still ticks, it just goes unseen.
 *
 * Visual-only, no text, and `pointerEvents="none"` so it never intercepts a tap.
 * It fills toward the current fraction, nudges off zero so the first upload does
 * not look stuck, then runs to full and fades out when the batch finishes.
