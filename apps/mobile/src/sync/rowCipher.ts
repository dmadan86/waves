/**
 * At-rest encryption for the offline mirror's payloads (ADR-005 durability +
 * privacy).
 *
 * The mirror is a plain SQLite file in the app sandbox (`driver.ts`). The
 * sandbox and full-disk encryption keep it from other apps and from a powered-
 * off, locked device — but a rooted/jailbroken phone or a file-level backup can
 * read that file, and it holds the whole ledger: groups, expenses, splits,
 * balances, the mutation queue, autosaved drafts. So every value SQLite stores
 * in a `json` column is sealed here before it is written and opened after it is
 * read.
 *
 * Why application-layer and not SQLCipher: the sensitive content lives *only* in
 * the `json` columns, always read and written whole — no query ever filters or
 * sorts on it (see the SELECTs in `driver.ts`). Sealing that one column covers
 * the payload without swapping the native SQLite module, which on this Expo pin
 * would break autolinking (see the RN 0.87 revert). This is pure JS: a
 * ChaCha-family AEAD from `@noble/ciphers`, a random nonce per value, and a
 * 256-bit data-encryption key kept in the OS keystore.
 *
 * Trust boundary: this protects data *at rest* against off-device extraction,
 * rooted-filesystem access and backup theft. It does not defend a running,
 * unlocked, compromised device — the key is available to the app at runtime,
 * the same posture as the session token and BYOK model keys already held in
 * SecureStore (see `secureStorage.ts`, `aiKeys.ts`). A lock-gated key is a
 * possible future hardening, deliberately out of scope here.
 *
 * The module splits into a pure core (`seal`/`open`, key and nonce passed in,
 * no native imports) so the crypto round-trips can be unit-tested, and a thin
 * native layer (`loadKey`/`encryptWith`/`decryptWith`/`destroyKey`) that owns
 * the keystore and the RNG.
