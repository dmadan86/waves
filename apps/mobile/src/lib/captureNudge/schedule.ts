/**
 * The half that talks to the operating system: read what alarm we hold, drop
 * it, set a new one.
 *
 * ## Local, not a push
 *
 * `scheduleNotificationAsync` with a DATE trigger — the phone setting an alarm
 * on itself. Nothing here goes near `waves_notify`, `notify-fanout` or pg_cron,
 * and the reasons are argued in full in `docs/plan-recurring-money-events.md`
 * §5.1. The short version, for the capture inbox specifically:
 *
 * - The server would have to be told what somebody is holding unfiled and how
 *   long they have held it, in order to decide whether to say anything. Nothing
 *   needs to know that but the phone, which already does.
 * - `notifications.title` and `.body` are plaintext columns read by the fanout,
 *   by the email claim and by the operator console. A reminder about a person's
 *   own unfiled receipts does not belong in a shared table.
 * - There is no per-user time zone anywhere in this schema — only
 *   `groups.time_zone` — so a server job has no hour to fire at. The device has
 *   the only clock that knows what "this evening" means here.
 * - It needs nothing: no FCM/APNs credentials, no EAS project id, no
 *   `push_tokens` row, no Vault secret, no cron. Five things that must all hold
 *   for a server push to land, against one (permission) for this.
 *
 * ## Nothing here throws, and nothing here is required
 *
 * `expo-notifications` is a native module. It is imported the same way
 * `lib/push.ts` imports it — statically, because it is already in every binary
 * this code can reach, and guarded by `pushSupported` before any call, because
 * reaching into it on web throws rather than no-opping and would take the whole
 * app down on the platform this repo uses for visual checks. Every exported
 * function below swallows its own failures and reports a value: a reminder that
 * could not be set is a reminder that does not happen, never a crash in a
 * headless component nobody is looking at.
 *
 * ## Why the OS list is the source of truth
 *
 * What we hold is read back from `getAllScheduledNotificationsAsync` rather
 * than from our own storage, and matched on a `key` inside the payload. A
 * reinstall, a "clear all", another build's leftovers — the list is the only
 * thing that actually knows. Our stored copy records when the last one was
 * *due*, which the list cannot tell us because a fired notification simply
 * disappears from it.
