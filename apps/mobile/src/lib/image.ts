/**
 * Choosing a picture, and making it a sensible size before it leaves the phone.
 *
 * A 2026 phone camera produces a 12-megapixel JPEG somewhere north of 4 MB. The
 * app displays an avatar at 78pt and a group cover a little larger, so
 * uploading the original means paying — in the free tier's storage (ADR-011),
 * in the person's mobile data, and again in every signed-URL fetch — for
 * roughly forty times the pixels that will ever be drawn.
 *
 * `quality` on the picker alone does not fix this: it re-compresses at the same
 * dimensions, so a 4000×3000 photo stays 4000×3000. The resize is the part that
 * matters, and it happens here rather than at each call site so that no future
 * upload can forget it.
 *
 * The bucket ceilings (5 MB for covers, 2 MB for avatars) stay where they are.
 * They are the backstop for the case where this code did not run, not the
 * mechanism.
