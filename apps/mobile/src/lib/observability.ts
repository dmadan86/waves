/**
 * Crash reporting, on terms Waves can live with.
 *
 * TDR §11 asks for crash-free sessions above 99.5%, which needs something
 * counting sessions and crashes. The awkward part is what else that something
 * picks up on the way: a Sentry event, left to its defaults, carries the URL of
 * the request that failed, the last few console lines, and whatever the app
 * handed it as context. In an expense splitter that is a list of who ate with
 * whom, the number they were invited on, and the handle they pay from.
 *
 * So nothing leaves without going through `scrub` from @waves/core — the same
 * policy the web view and the edge functions use, tested there rather than
 * here. This file is the wiring; `packages/core/src/observability/scrub.ts` is
 * the rule.
 *
 * With no DSN set this is inert: `init` returns immediately and every other
 * function is a no-op. A developer without a Sentry account runs the app with
 * no reporting rather than a crash on boot, and no build step is required to
 * make that true.
 */

 * *read* the project, `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`, is a build-time secret and never
 * enters the bundle (TDR §11).
