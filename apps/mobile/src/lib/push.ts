/**
 * Registering this device to be tapped on the shoulder.
 *
 * Two decisions worth stating, because both are easy to get wrong in a way
 * nobody notices:
 *
 * **Permission is never asked for on launch.** A money app that opens with
 * "Waves would like to send you notifications" gets denied, and on iOS a denial
 * is close to permanent — the only way back is Settings, which nobody visits.
 * So the prompt happens when somebody turns notifications on, having read what
 * they are for. If permission is already granted the token is refreshed
 * silently, because that costs nothing and a stale token is a person who
 * quietly stops hearing from us.
 *
 * **Signing out revokes the token rather than deleting the row.** The same
 * token coming back later is the same device, and the row is the evidence of
 * that.
 *
 * **Nothing here throws.** Asking for a token is a network call into FCM (on
 * Android) or APNs (on iOS) by way of Expo, and it rejects for reasons that
 * have nothing to do with the person holding the phone: no
 * `google-services.json` in this build, a Firebase project with the wrong
 * package name, an aeroplane. `refreshPushToken` is called with `void` on
 * every sign-in, so a rejection there is an unhandled one at launch. The
 * failures come back as a reason instead, and the notifications screen says
 * which one it was.
