/**
 * The capture inbox: expenses caught before they had a group (A34).
 *
 * Each row is a spend the user pinned for later — an amount, maybe a note and a
 * photo of the bill — waiting to be assigned to a group. Assigning opens the
 * ordinary add-expense form prefilled; saving there turns the capture into a
 * real group expense and drops it from this list. Everything here is personal
 * and offline-first: a row still queued wears a faint cloud glyph rather than
 * hiding until the server has seen it (ADR-005). Expenses spoken in one breath
 * fold into a single collapsible "N expenses" row with the running total.
