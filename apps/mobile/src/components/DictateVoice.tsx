/**
 * The microphone itself.
 *
 * Speech recognition is the platform's own — `SFSpeechRecognizer` on iOS,
 * `SpeechRecognizer` on Android — and on-device whenever the phone can manage
 * it, so what somebody says at a restaurant table is not shipped to a server to
 * be turned into "Beach shack dinner". Where the phone has no on-device model
 * the OS falls back to its network recogniser, which is the same recogniser the
 * keyboard's own mic key uses.
 *
 * **Nothing imports this file directly.** It is reached through
 * `DictateButton`, which loads it inside a `try`, because the import below
 * throws on any binary built before the native module existed — see the note
 * there.
 *
 * The native recogniser is a single global object with one event stream: every
 * mounted `DictateVoice` (a review screen shows one per expense row) subscribes
 * to the *same* `result`/`error`/`end` events — and so does the voice quick-add
 * panel on the other side of the app. So the mic is handed out by the shared
 * arbiter in `lib/speechMic`, one holder at a time, and each instance acts on an
 * event only while it is the holder: otherwise idle rows cross-write the
 * transcript, a row unmounting (the list changing after "add more") aborts a
 * capture some other surface just started, and the trailing events of a
 * torn-down session close the one that replaced it.
