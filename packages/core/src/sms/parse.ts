/**
 * Reading a bank SMS into a proposed expense.
 *
 * DEVIATION, recorded deliberately: TDR §10 lists SMS auto-import as out of
 * scope for v1. This module exists because it was asked for directly. It is
 * additive — nothing else depends on it — and the ledger rules are unchanged: a
 * parsed message is a *proposal*, never an entry.
 *
 * Three things this module will not do, all for the same reason:
 *
 *   - it does not touch the network, and nothing here is called from an edge
 *     function. A bank SMS carries an account tail, a balance, and sometimes a
 *     one-time password; sending it anywhere to be parsed would be a worse
 *     privacy trade than the feature is worth (ADR-013);
 *   - it does not write. `proposeFromSms` returns candidates, and a person
 *     confirms each one;
 *   - it does not guess at a split. Who was there is not in the message.
 *
 * Everything is parsed as digits and assembled into minor units. No float ever
 * exists between the text and the amount (ADR-003).
