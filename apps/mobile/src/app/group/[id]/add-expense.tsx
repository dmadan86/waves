            Viewing a bill puts its receipts at the top, above the card of facts
            and above the split; the form used to put them third, after the note
            and the day, so the same expense told its story in two different
            orders depending on whether you were reading it or writing it. The
            bill is also the thing a person is most often holding when they open
            this screen, and scanning it fills in the amount and the note below —
            so it belongs before the fields it populates, not after them.

            The bill is still a shortcut, not the screen: two small actions
            rather than a card that makes this look like a receipt scanner. Scan
            is metered and gives way when the group is capped; Add photo keeps an
            image on the device and never records a receipt server-side, so it
            is offered even at the cap.

            New expenses only. On an edit the gallery below is already the place
            bills are added and removed — it carries its own add tile — so these
            two would be a second door to the same room, one of which (scan)
            would also re-read a bill that has already been entered. */}

            printed.

            These four are all the same kind of question: a short answer, already
            filled in, changed from a sheet. They used to be spread across three
            places — the day in a card of its own here, the category and the rail
            behind the "More details" fold, and the currency only as a pill in
            the header — so a form that could have said what it knew in four
            lines instead made you find three different controls to read it.

            None of them is an advanced setting. An expense filed on the wrong
            day lands in the wrong month, the wrong trip and the wrong place in
            the feed; a bill paid on a card recorded as cash is wrong on the
            statement it is checked against; and a total in the wrong currency is
            simply a different number. Untouched, the day still inherits whatever
            it always had, so editing a note never moves a three-week-old dinner.

            Category is here as well as on the hero badge above: the badge shows
            the guess, which is what you want while typing the note, but it is
            not a control — this row is where the guess is overruled. */}
