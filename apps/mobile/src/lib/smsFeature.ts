/**
 * The two gates the inbox reader has to pass, and the one rule that decides
 * whether pasting is offered at all.
 *
 * `sms_inbox_read` has sat in `feature_flags` since the baseline migration with
 * `enabled=false`, read by nothing. This file is what makes it real. It is not
 * a second flag mechanism: the variant still comes from `lib/flags.tsx`, which
 * is the one place this app asks the server what is switched on.
 *
 * TWO GATES, AND NEITHER SUBSTITUTES FOR THE OTHER.
 *
 *   1. **Build.** `plugins/withSmsReader.js` puts `android.permission.READ_SMS`
 *      in the manifest only when `WAVES_SMS_READER=1` was set at prebuild.
 *      Google Play scans the manifest of the artefact it is given, and a
 *      restricted permission held without an approved core use case is grounds
 *      for removal — so a runtime switch is no help at all here, and the
 *      default artefact simply must not contain the permission.
 *      `app.config.ts` records the same decision in `extra.smsReader` so the
 *      running app can read it back rather than guess.
 *
 *   2. **Runtime.** `sms_inbox_read` decides whether a phone that *could* read
 *      the inbox is offered the option. Off is the fallback for everything:
 *      no session, no flag row, a failed fetch (`lib/flags.tsx` says why).
 *
 * The variant is compared against `'treatment'` rather than merely asked
 * whether the person is enrolled. The flag's arms are `{control, treatment}`,
 * and "enrolled at all" would hand the reader to the control group too —
 * which is both a broken experiment and a wider exposure of a restricted
 * permission than anybody asked for. `useFlagVariant` returning null (outside
 * the rollout) means "behave as the app did before the flag existed", which is
 * exactly: paste only.
 *
 * Pasting itself is gated by neither. It needs no permission, works on iPhone,
 * and is the whole feature on iOS.
