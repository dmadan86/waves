/**
 * The key model for a backup that has to survive the phone it was made on.
 *
 * THE TENSION. The offline mirror is already encrypted at rest (`sync/
 * rowCipher.ts`) with a 256-bit key minted on the device and kept in the OS
 * keystore under `AFTER_FIRST_UNLOCK_THIS_DEVICE_ONLY`. That flag is not an
 * accident: it stops the key travelling in an iCloud or Android backup, so a
 * restored copy of the SQLite file is unreadable on a new phone. Which is
 * exactly right for a local cache — and exactly wrong for a backup, whose only
 * job is to be readable on a new phone. Sealing the Drive file with the mirror
 * DEK would produce a file nobody, including its owner, could ever open again.
 *
 * THE THREE OPTIONS, and why this one.
 *
 * 1. *Upload it in the clear.* Then the personal ledger — every solo expense,
 *    every loan, every income line — is readable by anyone who reaches the
 *    Google account, and by Google. The whole premise of the "Me" tab is that
 *    it is private; a backup that quietly undoes that is worse than no backup.
 *    Rejected.
 *
 * 2. *A password the user picks.* Nicest to use, and what most people expect.
 *    But a human-chosen password has maybe 30 bits of entropy against a file an
 *    attacker can copy and grind offline forever, so it is only safe behind a
 *    memory-hard KDF — Argon2id or scrypt with real parameters. That is a new
 *    crypto dependency and a tuning decision (a KDF slow enough to matter on a
 *    laptop is slow on a five-year-old Android), and getting either wrong
 *    produces something that *looks* encrypted. Deliberately not done here.
 *
 * 3. *A key the app generates.* 32 random bytes, shown to the person once as 64
 *    hexadecimal characters, kept in this device's keystore for convenience,
 *    and typed in on any new device that wants to restore. Full 256-bit
 *    entropy, so there is nothing to grind and no KDF to get wrong: the key is
 *    used directly as the XChaCha20-Poly1305 key, through the same `seal`/`open`
 *    the mirror uses. This is WhatsApp's "64-digit encryption key" option,
 *    minus the password option beside it.
 *
 * THE COST, said plainly: **lose the key and the backup is gone.** Nobody can
 * recover it — not Waves, which never sees it, and not Google, which holds only
 * ciphertext. The screen says this before it makes one, and refuses to make a
 * backup until the person has been shown the key.
 *
 * A future password option can be added beside this without changing the file
 * format: the envelope already names its algorithm, and a password variant
 * would add a `kdf` block rather than replace anything.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * WHAT THE ABOVE GOT WRONG, and where the answer moved to. Everything from
 * "THE THREE OPTIONS" down is still exactly right about the *cryptography* and
 * exactly wrong about the *default*. It ends by naming this "WhatsApp's
 * '64-digit encryption key' option, minus the password option beside it", and
 * misses that in WhatsApp this is not a default at all: it is the opt-in
 * end-to-end encrypted backup, buried in settings, and WhatsApp's default Drive
 * backup asks for no key whatsoever. Shipping the advanced tier as the only
 * tier produced a Backup screen where nothing worked until you copied 64 hex
 * characters somewhere, which is the report that started the rework.
 *
 * So the key model now has two tiers, and this file is the machinery for both
 * of them rather than the argument for one. `tier.ts` holds the argument: on
 * **Standard**, the default, everything below still happens except that the key
 * is never shown to anybody and a copy of it goes into the same hidden Drive
 * folder as the backup. On **Extra protection**, opt-in, it is exactly what is
 * described above — shown once, this device only, never escrowed.
 *
 * Nothing in the code below changed. The key is the same 32 bytes, minted the
 * same way, used directly as the XChaCha20-Poly1305 key through the same
 * `seal`/`open`; what changed is who else gets a copy, and that is a question
 * about tiers, not about crypto. `formatRecoveryKey` and `parseRecoveryKey` are
 * still only reached on the Extra path, because Standard has nothing to show.
