/**
 * Review's list: one run of drafts, newest first, under day headings.
 *
 * ## The cut that stayed, and the one that went
 *
 * Two things separate these rows, and only one of them earns a place in the
 * layout.
 *
 * **Where a draft came from** is a tab, and stays one:
 *
 *   * **SMS** — read out of the phone's bank messages, or pasted in from one.
 *     Nobody asked for these; the app went and got them, and a person arrives
 *     wanting to know what it found while they were not looking.
 *   * **Added by you** — typed, spoken or photographed. Every one is something
 *     a person did on purpose and already knows about; they are here only
 *     because they have not been told which group they belong to yet.
 *
 * Two errands, not two degrees of one. "What did it find?" and "where do mine
 * go?" are asked at different moments and answered by different gestures, and
 * mixing them meant a morning's bank messages buried the three lunches somebody
 * typed on purpose.
 *
 * **What the app was sure of** used to cut each tab again, into *Ready* and
 * *Worth a look*, with a counted heading over each. Those headings are gone.
 * The reasoning for them was sound and the result was not: on a tab holding a
 * hundred and forty drafts, "READY 134" is a band of furniture above a list
 * whose first row is about to say the same thing better. Because the doubt is
 * already **on the row** — `doubtsAbout` drives a mark there, naming the part
 * the parser was unsure of — the heading was never where a person learned it.
 * It only said how many, which is a number the tab above already carries.
 *
 * So the confidence cut survives where it was always most useful (the row) and
 * leaves the layout it was not earning. What remains is the shape a list of
 * questions wants: the drafts, in the order they arrived, with a day heading
 * when and only when the pile spans more than one day.
 *
 * Everything here is pure so the arithmetic of "which tab, in what order" can
 * be pinned by a test with no device (mobile's vitest renders nothing; see
 * vitest.config.ts).
