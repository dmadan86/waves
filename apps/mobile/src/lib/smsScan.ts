/**
 * One scan of the inbox, with something to watch while it happens.
 *
 * The reader used to work invisibly: a pass ran on a foreground event or an
 * hourly alarm, drafts appeared in Review some time later, and the only
 * evidence anything had happened was that a list had got longer while nobody
 * was looking. That is the right behaviour for a background job and the wrong
 * one for the moment a person taps **Scan** — a button that returns instantly
 * and changes a number somewhere else is a button nobody believes twice.
 *
 * So a scan is an *event* here, with three stages a person can see:
 *
 *   1. **Reading** — the native call, indeterminate. It is one round trip into
 *      Android's SMS provider and it has no progress to report; pretending
 *      otherwise with a fake bar would be a small lie told every time.
 *   2. **Sorting** — the parse, in batches of {@link CHUNK}, reporting how far
 *      through it is. Batching is not only for the bar: parsing nine hundred
 *      messages is several hundred milliseconds of synchronous regex work, and
 *      without a yield between batches the progress bar would be painted once,
 *      at the end, on a frozen thread.
 *   3. **Saving** — writing to the on-device store, then turning the confident
 *      expenses into drafts.
 *
 * ## What it writes, and where
 *
 * **Every message goes to the device store** (`smsMessageStore`), whichever
 * pile it fell in — expense, income, or neither. That store never syncs.
 *
 * **Only confident expenses become captures.** A capture syncs, and it appears
 * in Review, which is the list of things waiting on a person. Putting every
 * half-read message there would make Review a place to avoid, and a draft made
 * from a message the parser only half understood is a question, not an answer.
 * Those stay on the Bank messages screen, where somebody can tick them
 * deliberately. Nothing is lost either way: the message is on the device and
 * the screen shows it.
 *
 * **A capture made here still carries no message body**, exactly as before.
 * `planSmsDrafts` is handed every key as a read key and no bodies at all, so
 * `rawText` is null by construction — twice over, since it ignores bodies for
 * read keys anyway.
 *
 * ## What it never does
 *
 * It never asks for a permission, only checks one. It never reports a count, a
 * merchant or a body to Sentry, Clarity or anything else — the prohibition
 * `smsDrafts.ts` states at length. And it never throws: the callers are a
 * screen, a foreground effect and a headless WorkManager wake-up, and none of
 * them has anywhere useful to put an exception.
