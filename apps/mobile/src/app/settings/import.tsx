/**
 * Bringing a ledger in — from Splitwise, or from Waves itself (ADR-012).
 *
 * The parsing is the easy half and lives in `packages/core`. This screen is the
 * other half: deciding which name in the file is which person here, and being
 * straight about what each kind of file does and does not contain.
 *
 * A **Splitwise** export holds each person's *net* for every row. It does not
 * hold who paid — many (paid, owed) pairs produce the same net, and the file
 * keeps none of them. Balances come across to the paisa; the payer on each row
 * is a deterministic reconstruction, and the preview says so in those words,
 * because somebody who later opens a row and finds they apparently paid for a
 * dinner they did not pay for deserves to have been told first.
 *
 * A **Waves** export holds the real (paid, owed) pair and the settlements
 * besides, so nothing is reconstructed. What still does not survive is stated
 * in ./import's own words on screen: ids, edit history and settlement
 * allocations are new, and that is what "lossless" honestly covers (M5).
