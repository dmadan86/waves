/**
 * An on-device cache for receipt images, so a bill you have opened once stays
 * readable with no network — the offline half of ADR-005 applied to images.
 *
 * The problem it solves: receipt bytes live behind short-lived signed URLs
 * (`r2-sign`), and the signature rotates every time, so expo-image's own
 * URL-keyed disk cache never gets a hit — and offline the URL cannot even be
 * minted. This keeps the bytes under a stable key (the object's storage path),
 * so the same image resolves to a local `file://` that works on a plane.
 *
 * It lives in `Paths.cache`, which the OS may reclaim under storage pressure —
 * correct for a cache: a purge only means the next online view re-downloads it,
 * never lost data. Every call is best-effort and swallows its own errors: a
 * cache miss or a write failure must degrade to the online path, never throw a
 * receipt view.
