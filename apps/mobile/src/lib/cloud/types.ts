/**
 * The shape a personal-cloud backend is reduced to.
 *
 * Only Google Drive implements this today, and that is deliberate — but the
 * seam stays because the interesting part of "back up somewhere that is yours"
 * is the *somewhere*, and Dropbox, OneDrive and Box are the same three calls
 * with different endpoints. An earlier version of this file carried all four
 * (PR #164, deleted by #393 when receipt images moved to R2); this one is the
 * ledger-backup half of that, narrowed to one provider so there is exactly one
 * OAuth console dependency to set up rather than four.
 *
 * The interface is deliberately not about images. A personal backup is one
 * small named blob of text that gets read back whole, so the provider only has
 * to find it, write it, and hand it back — no folder trees, no thumbnails, no
 * partial reads.
