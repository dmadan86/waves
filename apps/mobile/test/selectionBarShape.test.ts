/**
 * Where a selection is reported, and where it is acted on.
 *
 * Review and Bank messages are the two screens in this app where somebody ticks
 * a pile of rows and then does one thing to all of them, and both used to put
 * the same four kinds of control in one band at the bottom: how many are
 * ticked, "select all", the button that throws them away, and the buttons that
 * file them. Every list with a selection mode that is well made — Todoist,
 * Matter, GitHub, Quo, Yami — splits those in the same place instead. The count
 * and the scope control go to the header, because they are *state*; the bottom
 * bar keeps only *actions*, because that is the band a thumb is aiming at.
 *
 * Two things went wrong while they shared a band. "Select all" sat a few pixels
 * from "not an expense" — a scope control beside one that destroys work — and
 * the bar was two rows tall on a screen whose whole point is the list behind it.
 *
 * Source-reading, like `screenHeroShape.test.ts`, and for the same reason:
 * these screens pull in Reanimated and gesture-handler through their sheets and
 * cannot be mounted in this suite, but which half of the file a control is
 * written in is legible in the text.
