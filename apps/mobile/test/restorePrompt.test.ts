/**
 * The dashboard's one-time offer to bring a Drive backup back.
 *
 * The happy path is the least interesting thing here. What is worth pinning
 * down is every way the offer must *not* be made — because the failure that
 * matters is not a prompt that never appears, it is one that asks somebody with
 * four hundred records whether they have lost their data. So most of this file
 * is about silence: a phone that already holds a ledger, a build that cannot
 * reach Drive, a count read before anything has been looked at, and an answer
 * that has to outlive an app restart.
 *
 * The dismissal half is exercised against the real store rather than a fake,
 * because "it sticks" is a claim about AsyncStorage keys and their owner
 * scoping, and a fake would be asserting that the test's own map works.
