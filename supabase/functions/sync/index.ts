/**
 * sync — the offline queue's other half (ADR-005 / TDR §4).
 *
 * One POST does both directions: it applies the client's queued mutations in
 * the order they were made, then returns everything that has changed in the
 * client's groups since its cursor. Push and pull share a request because they
 * have to share an instant — pulling separately would let a client see its own
 * write land twice, or not at all.
 *
 * Three invariants this function exists to hold:
 *
 *   **Replay is free.** Every mutation is keyed by a client-generated UUID and
 *   recorded in `sync_mutations` with the result it produced. A queue replayed
 *   after a crash gets the original answers back, not a second expense.
 *
 *   **The client never computes money.** Shares are recomputed here from
 *   `split_params` with the same @waves/core the app uses, and a client whose
 *   arithmetic disagrees is rejected with SHARE_MISMATCH rather than believed.
 *
 *   **One bad mutation is not a broken app.** A rejection is reported per
 *   mutation; the rest of the batch still applies, and the client is told
 *   exactly which one failed and why.
