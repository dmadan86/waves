/**
 * Bringing a Splitwise group across (TDR §10, M3).
 *
 * The acceptance bar is "CSV round-trips into correct balances", and the word
 * doing the work is *balances*. A Splitwise export does not contain enough to
 * reconstruct an expense exactly: each person's column is their **net** for
 * that row — what they paid minus what they owed — and many different
 * (paid, owed) pairs produce the same net.
 *
 * So this module is honest about what it can and cannot recover:
 *
 *   - balances are exact, to the paisa, and that is provable;
 *   - who paid is a *reconstruction* chosen deterministically, not the truth
 *     from the original group. Anyone whose net was positive is treated as
 *     having paid, in proportion to that net.
 *
 * Pretending otherwise would be the worse failure: an import that silently
 * invents a single payer would show a history that never happened, and the
 * person reading it has no way to tell.
 *
 * Amounts are parsed digit by digit. A CSV of somebody's entire financial
 * history is precisely where a float would quietly lose a paisa per row and
 * only show up as a balance that will not settle (ADR-003).
