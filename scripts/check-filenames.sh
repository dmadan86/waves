# Files that came from a mis-quoted shell command, rather than from anybody.
#
# Seven of them sat in the repo root for five milestones — `(value.length`,
# `b.currency`, `convert(money(100n` and friends, all empty, all swept in by
# `git add -A` after a heredoc or a `>` landed somewhere it should not have.
# Six more appeared in `packages/db` the day the first seven were removed.
# Nothing type-checks a filename, so nothing ever complained.
#
# Two rules, both about the *last* segment of the path:
#
#   1. It must end in an extension this repo actually uses. That is what
#      catches `b.currency` and `item.claimers))]`, which otherwise look like
#      ordinary dotted names.
#   2. Apart from the extension it must be ordinary — letters, digits, dot,
#      dash, underscore. Expo Router's `(tabs)` and `[id].tsx` are the
#      deliberate exceptions, and are spelled out rather than exempted by
#      loosening the character class for everybody.
#
# Adding a genuinely new kind of file means adding its extension here, which is
# the intended cost: it is one line, and it is a decision worth making once.
