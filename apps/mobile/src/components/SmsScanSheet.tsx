/**
 * Starting a scan, and watching it happen.
 *
 * The reader used to work invisibly — a pass ran, rows appeared somewhere, and
 * the only evidence was a list that had got longer while nobody was looking.
 * That is right for a background job and wrong for a button. A button that
 * returns instantly and changes a number on another screen is a button people
 * press once, disbelieve, and never press again.
 *
 * So this sheet is the whole event, start to finish, in one place:
 *
 *   1. **How far back?** Two choices, not a date picker, because there are two
 *      questions people actually have — catch up, or go back and get
 *      everything. The slow one says it is slow on the row that offers it,
 *      rather than in a toast after it has been chosen.
 *   2. **The hourly check, as a switch.** Whether Waves may wake the phone to
 *      look for new messages, or should only look when it is opened. It used to
 *      be a warning here — several manufacturers stop scheduled work by default
 *      (`lib/smsBattery.ts`) — and a warning is the wrong shape for it: there is
 *      nothing wrong, nothing to fix in the app, and messages are read on the
 *      way in either way. The question mark beside the switch holds what to
 *      change on the phones where the check does get stopped, named by maker.
 *   3. **Progress, in three honest stages.** Reading is indeterminate because
 *      the native call genuinely has no progress to report, and a fake bar is a
 *      small lie told every time. Sorting counts real messages. Saving is the
 *      short tail.
 *   4. **What it found.** Including the two numbers most apps leave out: how
 *      many looked like payments and could not be read, and how many were clear
 *      enough to have gone straight to Review without being asked about.
 *
 * The sheet cannot be dismissed while a scan is running. Not to trap anybody —
 * the scan would finish either way — but because leaving mid-progress is how a
 * person concludes it did not work.
