/**
 * Bank messages — its own screen, which is the whole point of it.
 *
 * This used to be part of Review, and it should not have been. Review is the
 * short list of things genuinely waiting on a person: four drafts, each one a
 * question with an answer. Bank messages are a *stream* — a quarter of them is
 * hundreds of rows, most of which nobody needs to do anything about — and
 * pouring a stream into a list of questions makes the questions unfindable.
 * Worse, it made the list change while nobody was looking: an hourly job would
 * add eleven rows to the screen a person was in the middle of reading.
 *
 * So they are two screens, and the verbs are different. Review is answered.
 * This is *worked*: searched, narrowed by date, ticked in batches, placed
 * together. Everything below follows from that.
 *
 * ## The shape
 *
 * **Three piles, not one list.** Spent, Received, Neither — `classifySms`
 * decides which, and the third is the one that earns the feature its keep. Every
 * row in it is a debit: a credit card bill paid out of the same account that
 * made the purchases, a wallet loaded, a fund bought, cash from a machine. Read
 * as expenses they double-count a whole month, and an app that showed them as
 * spending would be wrong in a way its user could feel but not explain. They are
 * shown, named, and not counted.
 *
 * **A scan is an event you can watch.** Not a number that changes on another
 * screen. `SmsScanSheet` owns the choice, the progress and the outcome.
 *
 * **The promise is on the screen, not in a settings page.** One line under the
 * title, and again inside the scan while somebody is watching their own bank
 * messages being read. It is the reason this feature can exist at all and it is
 * worth the two lines.
 *
 * **Ticking is the main verb, so the tick boxes are always there.** Not behind
 * a long press. "Select all" means the rows on screen — never the ones a search
 * is hiding, which is the one mistake here that would cost real money.
 *
 * ## What syncs, and what does not
 *
 * The messages live in a device-only database that the sync engine cannot see
 * (`lib/smsMessageStore.ts`). Placing rows in a group writes ordinary expenses
 * — the shop, the amount, the day — and nothing else. The bodies stay on the
 * phone. Nothing on this path reports a count, a merchant or a body to Sentry,
 * Clarity or any analytics.
