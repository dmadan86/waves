/**
 * notify-fanout — taps people on the shoulder about what is already in their
 * inbox (TDR §7.1).
 *
 * The inbox is written the moment something happens, by whichever job or RPC
 * caused it. This function is only the delivery half, and it is deliberately
 * dumb: claim, render, send, record. Everything that could be got wrong lives
 * somewhere it can be tested without a phone —
 *
 *   * claiming and closing out: `waves_claim_push_notifications`, which is an
 *     UPDATE rather than a SELECT so two overlapping runs cannot both send the
 *     same reminder;
 *   * building the messages and reading the tickets: `@waves/core`, including
 *     the mapping from a flat reply back to which device said what.
 *
 * Nobody signed in can call this. It reads other people's inboxes, which is the
 * service role's business and no one else's.
 *
 * The push half lives here as a pure function over injected boundaries (the
 * service client, an env reader, `fetch`, and the email half) so it can be
 * tested without Deno or a network. `index.ts` is the thin `Deno.serve` shell.
