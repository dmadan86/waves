/**
 * Who is holding the one microphone, and when the next capture may open it.
 *
 * Both platforms give the app a *single* recogniser object with a *single*
 * global event stream — `ExpoSpeechRecognitionModule.start/stop/abort` and the
 * `result`/`error`/`end` events are the same recogniser no matter which screen
 * asked. Every surface that dictates (the note mic on an expense, the quick-add
 * panel on the voice screen) therefore hears every other surface's events, and
 * a second `start()` issued before the previous session has finished tearing
 * down does not queue — it lands on top of it.
 *
 * That is the whole family of "the mic worked once and then went dead":
 *
 *  - **A stale `end` closes the new session.** `abort()` does not end the
 *    session there and then; it queues a teardown (Android posts it to the main
 *    looper, iOS runs it in a `Task`) and the `end` arrives some milliseconds
 *    later. By then the panel that aborted has usually been replaced by a fresh
 *    one, which — hearing an `end` it never asked for — decides its own capture
 *    is over before it has begun.
 *  - **The teardown eats the new recogniser.** That queued teardown calls
 *    `cancel()`/`destroy()` on whatever the recogniser field happens to hold
 *    when it finally runs. Start a new session first and it destroys *that* one,
 *    silently: no result, no error, no `end`, a mic stuck on "listening".
 *  - **Two starts at once.** Opening the mic is not instant on our side either
 *    — there is a permission call and an installed-model probe to await first —
 *    so two taps (or a tap racing the auto-start) can both get past a
 *    `listening` check and issue two native starts, with the same outcome.
 *
 * So one object owns the recogniser at a time, and the next owner waits for the
 * previous one's `end` before opening it. Kept free of React and of the native
 * module so the sequencing can be tested without a device — the microphone
 * itself is injected as a two-call driver.
 */

/**
 * How long to wait for the `end` a torn-down session still owes us before
 * assuming it will never come.
 *
 * A guard, not a schedule: `end` normally lands within a frame or two of the
 * teardown. But it is emitted by the native side, and if the app navigates away
 * while a capture is open there may be no component mounted to hand it to us at
 * all. Without the timer the mic would be locked shut for the rest of the
 * session — a far worse failure than the race it is protecting against.
