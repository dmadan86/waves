# Drives the Maestro flows inside the CI emulator. This lives in a file, invoked
# as a single line from the workflow, because android-emulator-runner parses its
# inline `script:` line-by-line — a multi-line `for` loop or a persisted `export`
# in the inline block would not survive that. One `bash e2e/run-maestro.sh` runs
# as one command, so the loop and PATH behave normally.
#
# Each flow mutates the shared staging backend (archive, leave, rename, delete),
# so the deterministic fixture is reseeded before every flow. The seed is
# idempotent (reset + rebuild) and each flow's login.yaml does clearState, so no
# state leaks across. Flows run one at a time so login.yaml is never standalone.
#
# Requires in the environment: E2E_SUPABASE_URL, E2E_SERVICE_KEY, E2E_EMAIL,
# E2E_PASSWORD (the seeder + Maestro read these).
