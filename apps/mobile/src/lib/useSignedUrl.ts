/**
 * Resolve a private-Storage path to a signed URL, and keep it fresh.
 *
 * Every signed URL the app mints for a private bucket (group photos, avatars,
 * capture receipts) expires after 60 minutes (see `data/api.ts`). Minted once
 * into state, it would go stale in place: a screen left open past the hour, or
 * an app resumed after longer, would show a broken image with nothing to
 * re-mint it. This re-resolves on two triggers that cover both cases — a timer
 * set safely inside the lifetime, and a return to the foreground when the last
 * mint is old enough to be worth spending a request on — so a URL that is
 * actually on screen never rots to a 401.
 *
 * The resolvers answer from a shared cache (`signedUrlCache`): a URL may reach
 * this hook already up to 45 minutes old, so the hook cannot time the refresh
 * from its own mount. It re-asks often instead — a cache hit costs no request
 * and, being the same string, no re-render — and the cache mints a new URL once
 * the old one is past its serving window, a quarter of an hour before expiry.
 *
 * The stale URL is cleared during render on a key change (not in an effect), so
 * the previous path's image never flashes for a frame under a new key.
