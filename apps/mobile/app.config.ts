/**
 * `app.json` stays the app's description of itself. This file adds the two
 * things that cannot be written down statically, both for the same reason:
 * they name an account that belongs to whoever is building, not to this
 * repository, and hard-coding a placeholder would break `expo prebuild` for
 * anybody who cloned this without one.
 *
 * **Sentry.** Its config plugin uploads source maps during the native build,
 * which is the difference between a stack trace and a column number in a
 * minified bundle. To do that it needs an organisation and a project, so the
 * plugin is added only when the build is actually configured to talk to
 * Sentry. Reporting itself is a separate switch (`EXPO_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN`): a
 * build can report crashes without uploading source maps, and reads them
 * minified.
 *
 * **FCM.** Android push goes Waves → Expo → FCM → the phone, and FCM will not
 * issue this app a token unless the binary was built with the Firebase
 * project's `google-services.json` in it. Setting `android.googleServicesFile`
 * is what puts it there. The file is not checked in — this repo is public, and
 * it names a Firebase project only one person should be able to point builds
 * at — so the path is resolved at config time from whichever exists:
 *
 *   1. `GOOGLE_SERVICES_JSON` — an EAS file secret. EAS downloads the file
 *      before the build and sets this to its absolute path.
 *   2. `apps/mobile/google-services.json` — a local copy, for `expo prebuild`
 *      and `expo run:android` on a development machine.
 *
 * And when neither exists, the key is left off entirely. A `googleServicesFile`
 * pointing at a file that is not there fails the build outright, which would
 * mean nobody could build this app until they had a Firebase account. Without
 * the key the app builds and runs; the only thing that does not work is
 * registering for push, and `lib/push.ts` says so in words rather than
 * throwing.
 *
 * Setting the credentials up is a console job — see README, "Turning on push".
