/**
 * The local mirror and how server changes fold into it (TDR §4 steps 3–4).
 *
 * The client keeps two layers, never one:
 *
 *   **server**  — exactly what the server last told us, addressed by the
 *                 per-group `updated_seq` cursor.
 *   **pending** — the mutation queue, replayed on top at read time.
 *
 * Keeping them apart is what makes "UI reads local-first, always" (ADR-005)
 * survive a pull. If optimistic edits were written into the server layer, a
 * pull that arrived before our own mutation was applied would revert the screen
 * under the user's finger. Here the pull only ever replaces the server layer,
 * and the pending edits are re-applied over the top, so the number on screen
 * only moves when the server actually disagrees.
