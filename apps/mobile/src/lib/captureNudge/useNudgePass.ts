/**
 * One pass over the reminder, from wherever the app happens to be.
 *
 * Two callers need exactly the same thing and must not each assemble it: the
 * headless `CaptureNudge`, which runs a pass when the inbox or the app's state
 * moves, and the switch on the notifications screen, which has to make its own
 * answer true the moment it is touched rather than at the next foreground. A
 * switch that takes effect later is a switch people press twice.
 *
 * The returned callback is fire-and-forget and never rejects: a reminder that
 * could not be set or cleared is reported to observability and otherwise
 * silent, because there is no screen this belongs on.
