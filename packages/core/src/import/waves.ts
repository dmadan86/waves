/**
 * Reading Waves's own export back in (M5, ADR-012).
 *
 * The M5 acceptance line is "export re-imports losslessly". Unlike a Splitwise
 * file — where each person's column is a *net* and the payer has to be
 * reconstructed (see ./splitwise.ts) — our own export carries the real (paid,
 * owed) pair for every expense and the settlements besides. So the balances
 * that come out are not merely correct in aggregate: every row is the row that
 * left.
 *
 * What *cannot* survive the trip is worth stating plainly, because an export
 * that claimed more than it delivers is the failure this file exists to avoid:
 *
 *   - **Ids change.** Every member, expense and settlement is new in the new
 *     group. Nothing else would be safe: a file could otherwise be made to
 *     overwrite rows in a group it was never part of.
 *   - **Edit history does not come.** The export holds every version (ADR-004);
 *     what returns is what each expense currently says. Those edits were made
 *     by people who are not members of the new group, and attributing them to
 *     whoever pressed Import would be a fiction. Balances are computed from
 *     current versions only, so nothing the acceptance criterion measures is
 *     lost.
 *   - **Settlement allocations do not come.** They name expense ids, and those
 *     ids are new. Allocations decide which expenses a payment is applied
 *     against, never how much anybody owes in total.
 *
 * Everything here is parsed from strings. The export writes minor units as
 * strings precisely so a JSON number — which is a double — never gets near
 * somebody's money (ADR-003).
