/**
 * Receipts on an expense — one gallery, many images (A46).
 *
 * This folds the old single "kept bill" and the separate "attachments" into one
 * surface. Every image is a receipt; each is either group-visible (any member
 * sees it) or private (only the expense's payers and author). Privacy is a per-
 * image choice, enforced at the DB + r2-sign — a private row a non-party cannot
 * see never reached this device, so the lock badge here is a label, not the
 * gate. Tapping a thumbnail opens a full-screen, swipeable, pinch-zoom viewer.
 *
 * The legacy bill (the fixed-key `receipts` object an older expense kept before
 * this gallery existed) is shown as the first, group-visible item so nothing is
 * orphaned; new images are all attachment rows.
