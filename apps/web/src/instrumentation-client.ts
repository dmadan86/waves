/**
 * Crash reporting for the guest view.
 *
 * This is the app that runs for somebody who has installed nothing — they
 * followed a link, and if the page breaks they close the tab and the group
 * never hears from them again. There is no crash dialog and no way for them to
 * tell anyone, so unreported is the default outcome here in a way it is not on
 * mobile.
 *
 * Every page is a client component (see next.config.ts), so this file is where
 * essentially all of the app's errors are. Events go through the same `scrub`
 * as the mobile app and the edge functions — one policy, tested in
 * @waves/core, not three that drift.
 *
 * Inert without a DSN, so a clone with no Sentry account builds and runs.
