/**
 * The guest ceilings, wired to this phone's guest (ADR-006 addendum).
 *
 * `@waves/core`'s `guestGate` decides; this hook feeds it who is asking (a
 * guest, and when their account was made) and how many groups they are in, then
 * hands screens two guards to call before a write. A full user gets a null gate
 * and both guards wave everything through, so a screen can call them
 * unconditionally.
 *
 * The guard both answers and acts: when a guest may not do the thing, it sends
 * them to the account screen with the reason, and returns `true` so the caller
 * bails. The pattern at the call site is `if (guard.blockWrite()) return;`.
