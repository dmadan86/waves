/**
 * Turning inbox rows into email (TDR §7.3).
 *
 * The same shape as `push.ts` and for the same reason: the sending is a `fetch`
 * in an edge function, and everything that can be got wrong is here, where a
 * test can read it without a mailbox.
 *
 * Three things this file decides:
 *
 *   * **What is worth an email at all.** Almost nothing is. Splitwise mails a
 *     person every time anybody buys a coffee, and the result is a filter rule.
 *     ADR-010 and TDR §7.3 allow a short list; `TEMPLATE_FOR_KIND` is that list
 *     written down, and a kind missing from it is a kind that never gets mailed
 *     no matter what the fanout is asked to do.
 *   * **What it says.** Nothing new. An email carries the same sentence as the
 *     inbox and the push, in the recipient's language, because it is the same
 *     notification arriving by a different door. What gets added is the chrome
 *     an email needs and a push has no room for: a button, why this arrived,
 *     and how to stop it.
 *   * **How to stop it.** One click, no login, no "manage preferences" page
 *     that asks who you are first. RFC 8058 requires the mailbox to be able to
 *     POST the unsubscribe URL itself, so that URL has to prove the address
 *     without a session — hence the signature rather than a bare `?email=`,
 *     which would let anybody unsubscribe anybody.
 *
 * `waves://` links are rewritten to the web-lite group page. A deep link is
 * exactly right on a phone and dead in desktop webmail, and the person reading
 * a settlement mail at a laptop is the one most likely to be at a laptop.
