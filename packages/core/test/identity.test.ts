/**
 * Signing in, and the one case that must never be got wrong.
 *
 * A guest has real data: a trip, a week of expenses, people who owe them
 * money. If "sign in with Google" calls `signInWithOAuth`, Supabase makes a
 * new user, the session swaps, and all of it belongs to an account they cannot
 * reach. Nothing errors. Nothing is deleted. It is simply gone, and the only
 * way back was the anonymous session that was just replaced.
 *
 * Every test in the first block is that failure, from a different angle.
