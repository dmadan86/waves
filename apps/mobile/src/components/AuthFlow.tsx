/**
 * Getting in — the shared machinery behind the login and the sign-up screens.
 *
 * There are two front doors, one file. `flow` decides which: `'login'` is the
 * screen a returning person lands on, and `'signup'` is the separate page behind
 * "Create account", where a new person picks how to start and where the guest
 * way in lives. Keeping both in one component is deliberate: the form underneath
 * is identical, and two copies of a login form is exactly how one drifts from
 * the other.
 *
 * The layout is one sheet with one hierarchy: a title and a muted line, the
 * email-and-password card, the passwordless links as text under it ("Email me
 * a code" on both doors, "Forgot password" on the login door — both mail a
 * one-time code to the address in the field, with a one-minute resend cool-down
 * so a frustrated tap cannot spray the mailbox), then the single primary button.
 * The other ways in — Google, Apple, phone — sit at the foot as three icon
 * tiles under a seam. Exactly one full-width button on the screen, on purpose:
 * the previous sheet stacked six of them at the same weight and read as bloat.
 *
 * Which Supabase call each button makes is decided in @waves/core, not here. A
 * guest who taps a provider or types a password must have that way *added* to the
 * account they already have — signing them in fresh would strand a week of
 * expenses on an account they can no longer reach (ADR-006). The passwordless
 * email-code path cannot express that "add in place", so it is hidden for a guest
 * (`isGuest`): they upgrade with a password or a provider, never a fresh code.
 *
 * ADR-006 is that nobody is made to register before they can split a bill. The
 * guest button sits on the sign-up page, one tap behind "Create account" — still
 * not behind a form, still reachable before any detail is asked, but off the
 * login screen a returning member sees. (ADR-006 addendum — see the PR.)

 *
