/**
 * The backup screen's whole state, in one hook.
 *
 * A React seam over three things that are not React — the settings on disk, the
 * OAuth tokens in the keystore, and the engine — plus the one thing that is: the
 * ledger itself, which only the mirror can produce. Kept out of the provider
 * tree on purpose. A backup is a settings screen and a once-a-day check, not
 * something every screen in the app needs a context for, and the app's provider
 * stack is already fifteen deep.
 *
 * A restore writes through the ordinary offline queue (`personal.upsert`), not
 * around it: the record ids in the backup are the same client-chosen ids that
 * are already the idempotency key, so restored rows converge with whatever the
 * server has exactly as a row typed on another phone would. That also means a
 * restore works with no connection at all — the rows land locally and leave when
 * the queue next drains, which is the ADR-005 promise applied to the one moment
 * people are least likely to have signal: setting up a new phone.
