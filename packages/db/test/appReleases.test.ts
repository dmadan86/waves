/**
 * The version policy is the one table in the database that can lock every
 * phone out of its own ledger, so what it refuses matters more than what it
 * stores.
 *
 * Two properties, both about the blast radius of a mistake:
 *
 *   - anybody can read it, including a signed-out guest, because the gate runs
 *     before the sign-in screen;
 *   - nobody can write it, including a signed-in person, because "which builds
 *     are allowed to open" is not a thing a client gets to decide.
