/**
 * One pass: read what is true, ask `planCaptureNudge` what to do, do it.
 *
 * The shape is deliberate — the reads are all above the decision and the writes
 * are all below it, so the rules stay in a function with no clock and no
 * storage of its own. Everything this module adds is plumbing.
 *
 * The one piece of reasoning that lives here rather than in the planner is how
 * "the last reminder that actually fired" is recovered, because it is a fact
 * about storage rather than about people. `expo-notifications` reports no
 * deliveries and a fired notification simply leaves the scheduled list, so the
 * only evidence is the fire time we wrote down when we set it: once that moment
 * is in the past, the reminder went off. Which is also why a cancel only clears
 * the marker when it is still in the future — wiping the record of a reminder
 * that already happened would hand back the ceiling it spent.
