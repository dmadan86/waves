/**
 * Google Drive, as a place to keep one encrypted backup file.
 *
 * The scope is `drive.appdata` and nothing else. That is the narrowest thing
 * Google offers: it grants access to a hidden per-application folder — the
 * *appDataFolder* — and to nothing whatsoever in the user's visible Drive. The
 * app cannot list their documents, cannot read a photo, cannot be tricked into
 * it, because the token was never issued for it. The wider `drive.file` scope
 * the deleted receipt-backup version used would have put the backup in the
 * user's own file list, which reads as tidier and is strictly more access than
 * this needs; `drive` (full) is never requested and never should be.
 *
 * What the user sees in exchange for the narrow scope: the file does not show
 * up in their Drive. It is still theirs — Drive's storage settings list the app
 * and offer "Delete hidden app data", and the quota it uses is their quota —
 * but they cannot open it, and it would be meaningless if they did, because it
 * is sealed with a key Google does not have (see `backup/recoveryKey.ts`).
 *
 * There is exactly one file, overwritten in place, so the appDataFolder never
 * accumulates and a restore never has to choose between candidates.
