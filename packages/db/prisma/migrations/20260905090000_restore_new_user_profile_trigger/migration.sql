-- The trigger that gives a new account its profile row, put back.
--
-- `public.waves_handle_new_user()` mirrors an `auth.users` insert into
-- `public.profiles`. The function survived the 2026-09-04 squash into
-- `20260904000000_waves_baseline`; **the trigger did not**. The baseline was
-- built from a schema-only dump of a local plain Postgres, and a plain Postgres
-- has no `auth` schema at all — so a trigger that lives on `auth.users` could
-- never appear in it. This is the same loss that took the 19 `storage.objects`
-- policies, and for exactly the same reason.
--
-- What it cost: every account created on a rebuilt project since 2026-09-04 got
-- an `auth.users` row and no profile. The app reads `profiles` for the signed-in
-- person, so the dashboard fell back to initials for a name it did not have and
-- the settings tab — which holds a skeleton until the profile arrives — never
-- stopped loading.
--
-- Two halves, both idempotent: re-create the trigger, then backfill the accounts
-- that were created while it was missing.

-- ─────────────────────────────── 0. one reading of the metadata, not three ──
--
-- A profile must not depend on which path created it. There are three:
-- this trigger, the backfill below, and the client's self-heal in `auth.tsx`.
-- They disagreed on the avatar: Google sends the photo under `picture` as well
-- as `avatar_url`, and a provider that sends only `picture` gave a face through
-- two of the three paths and initials through this one. Same ladder everywhere
-- now — replaced rather than created, so this is safe to re-run.
