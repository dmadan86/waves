/**
 * The one seam between the app and its backend.
 *
 * Historically every file reached for `supabase` directly — `supabase.rpc(...)`,
 * `supabase.from(...)`, `supabase.auth.*` — so the whole app knew the name of
 * its vendor. This module is the single place that name is allowed. Everything
 * else imports `backend` and talks to the `Backend` interface below; the
 * concrete Supabase client is injected here and nowhere else (see
 * `lib/supabase.ts`, the adapter).
 *
 * Why this shape (and not deeper domain ports): the `Backend` surface is the
 * exact slice of the client the app uses, typed as an allow-list — so a second
 * implementation only has to provide these members, and a rogue `supabase.xyz`
 * elsewhere no longer type-checks. The read methods (`from`) keep PostgREST's
 * shape on purpose: the escape-hatch stack (`infra/self-host`) and any managed
 * PostgREST are drop-in, so the reads move untouched. Shedding PostgREST itself
 * (a non-REST backend) is the deeper `DataPort` work called out in MIGRATION.md
 * — deliberately not done here.
 *
 * The auth surface, by contrast, IS fully behind this interface — it is the
 * stickiest lock-in (anonymous guests, in-place upgrade, id-token sign-in), so
 * pinning exactly which calls the app makes is what makes a future swap legible.
