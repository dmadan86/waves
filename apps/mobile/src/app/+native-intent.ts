/**
 * Rewrite incoming native deep links before expo-router tries to match them.
 *
 * The one link that needs rewriting is the OAuth callback. Google and Apple
 * sign-in redirect to `waves://auth?code=…` — see
 * `makeRedirectUri({ scheme: 'waves', path: 'auth' })` in `lib/auth.tsx`. The
 * code exchange is already done in-process: `WebBrowser.openAuthSessionAsync`
 * hands that URL straight back to the caller, which calls
 * `exchangeCodeForSession` (a one-time code; a second delivery is worthless). So
 * by the time the OS *also* delivers the link as an app intent, it carries
 * nothing left to do — and there is no `/auth` screen, so letting the router match it
 * lands on "Unmatched Route — page could not be found" right after a successful
 * Google login. Send it to the root instead, where the session (now set)
 * decides between the tabs and the sign-in screen.
 *
 * This runs outside the app context, so it cannot read auth state — it only
 * rewrites the path. It must never throw: a crash here would take the cold
 * launch down with it, so anything unexpected passes straight through.
 *
 * @param path the incoming link. Named `path` but it is the full URL (e.g.
 *   `waves://auth#…`), not just the path portion.

    // fires the scanner only on the first tap of a warm process and silently
    // drops to the plain form thereafter. Rewriting to a fresh `Date.now()`
