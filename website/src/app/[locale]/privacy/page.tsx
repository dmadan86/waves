Product analytics, if enabled, is opt-in and can be turned off in the app at any time.',

Deleting your account removes your rows and your sign-in identity; what you added inside a shared group — expenses and settlements, the notes and comments on them, and any receipt images — is anonymised rather than deleted, so the group balance does not silently change for everyone else. Nothing is retained for advertising, and nothing is retained because a law obliges us to.',
