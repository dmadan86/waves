/**
 * fx-rate — today's mid-market rate, as an exact rational (ADR-003).
 *
 * Two things this deliberately is not:
 *
 * It is not the only way to get a rate into an expense. Typing one, or deriving
 * it from a card statement, works offline and is often *more* accurate — a bank
 * charges its own rate with its own markup, and a mid-market number will never
 * match anybody's statement. This endpoint is the convenience, not the truth.
 *
 * It is not a float. The upstream publishes decimals; we turn them into num/den
 * at the boundary and never let a double past it, because the rate stored on an
 * expense has to reproduce the same minor units a year from now.
 *
 * Rates come from the ECB via Frankfurter, which needs no key and publishes
 * daily reference rates. It is behind auth anyway so this cannot be used as an
 * open currency proxy on somebody else's bill.
