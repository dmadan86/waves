/**
 * Who Waves already has, read off the mirror.
 *
 * The picker used to offer every contact identically, so adding six people to a
 * trip and then adding a seventh next week meant re-reading the same list with
 * no memory of the six. This is that memory, and it is built entirely out of
 * rows the device already holds: the ghost members in your own groups, each of
 * which carries the one email or number you gave when you invited them.
 *
 * It is deliberately *not* a contact-book upload wearing a different hat. The
 * index is assembled on the phone from the local mirror (ADR-005), matched on
 * the phone by `lib/contactMatch`, and never sent anywhere; the address book is
 * read to find the match and is not stored. Nothing here can say which of your
 * contacts use Waves — only which of them you have already written down
 * yourself, which is a question your own device can answer without telling a
 * server about anybody (ADR-006).
 *
 * Members who joined with a real account carry no address here, because a
 * profile deliberately does not expose an email or a number another member
 * could read. They are matched by name instead, which is why that rule exists
 * at all and why it is confined to rows that have nothing better.
