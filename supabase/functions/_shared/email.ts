/**
 * Handing a built email to whichever provider carries it (TDR §7.3).
 *
 * Everything worth testing is in `@waves/core` — what may be mailed, what it
 * says, what the unsubscribe link is. This file is the part that cannot be
 * tested without a network: an API key, a `From`, and the handful of decisions
 * that only matter when the send goes wrong.
 *
 * The one that matters most is the difference between "this will never work"
 * and "this did not work just now". A provider refusing an address permanently
 * and a provider being rate-limited look almost identical at the call site, and
 * getting them the wrong way round means either a settlement confirmation is
 * silently dropped or a dead address is retried every five minutes forever.
 * That rule is decided once, in `sendVia`, and applied to every provider.
