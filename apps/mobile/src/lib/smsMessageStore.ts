/**
 * Bank messages, kept on this phone and nowhere else.
 *
 * This is the file that makes the promise on the Bank messages screen true, so
 * it is worth being exact about what the promise is. It is **not** "the app
 * keeps no copy" — the screen shows the original message when a row is opened,
 * and a search that matches the shop has to have something to match against.
 * It is "no copy leaves the device", and that is a structural claim, not a
 * careful one:
 *
 *   * This is a **separate database file** from `waves.db`. The sync engine
 *     reads exactly two tables — `mirror_rows` and `pending_mutations` — and
 *     neither is in this file. There is no code path, correct or buggy, that
 *     walks a table it never opens. A row here cannot be enqueued by accident
 *     because `enqueue` has no idea it exists.
 *   * Every body is **sealed at rest** with the same key the ledger mirror uses
 *     (`sync/rowCipher`), bound to its own row identity. A phone backup that
 *     carries the file without the Keystore entry carries ciphertext.
 *   * Signing out **destroys the file**, not merely its rows. The mirror's
 *     crypto-erase drops the key; this drops the data that key protected, so
 *     the two cannot end up in different states.
 *
 * WHAT SYNCS INSTEAD. When somebody ticks rows here and places them in a group,
 * the *facts* become an expense the ordinary way — amount, shop, day. The body
 * stays here, and so do the drafts made from these messages until they are
 * used (`lib/smsDraftStore`). `lib/smsDrafts.ts` states that rule at
 * length and enforces it; this is where the other half of it lives, which is
 * that a body has somewhere to be other than nowhere.
 *
 * AND NOTHING IS REPORTED. No count, no merchant, no sender reaches Sentry,
 * Clarity or any analytics from this file. A stack trace from a bank-message
 * store is exactly the kind of thing that carries somebody's shop into a
 * dashboard, so the catches here are silent on purpose.
