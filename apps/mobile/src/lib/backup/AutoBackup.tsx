/**
 * The automatic half of "Automatic backup: Daily / Weekly / Monthly".
 *
 * A headless component, mounted once inside the lock and auth gates. It renders
 * nothing; it exists because the only honest source for the ledger is a hook,
 * and a hook needs somewhere to live.
 *
 * What it deliberately is *not* is a background task. There is no OS alarm here
 * — no `expo-background-task`, no `WorkManager`, no BGTaskScheduler. A phone
 * that has not been opened in a week has not backed up in a week, and the screen
 * says when the last one was rather than implying a schedule the OS never
 * promised to keep. (Both platforms treat background work as discretionary:
 * iOS decides when, or whether, a refresh task runs, and Android's Doze defers
 * everything on an idle device. An app that says "daily" and means it needs a
 * native module and a battery conversation, and that is a separate decision.)
 *
 * So: check when the app comes to the foreground, and once on mount. That is
 * enough to make a daily backup happen daily for anyone who opens the app
 * daily, which is the population the setting is for.
