/**
 * Reading bank SMS off the phone, on Android, with the user's permission.
 *
 * The paste screen is the feature (`app/captures/paste.tsx`), and on iPhone it
 * is the whole of it: iOS has no API that reads Messages at any tier. This
 * module is the Android path laid on top — a one-tap read of the inbox that
 * fills the same candidate list a paste does.
 *
 * IT IS NOT REACHABLE BY DEFAULT, and that is enforced twice over, in
 * `lib/smsFeature.ts`: the manifest declares `READ_SMS` only in a build made
 * with `WAVES_SMS_READER=1` (Play scans the artefact, so this half cannot be a
 * runtime switch), and the `sms_inbox_read` flag decides whether a phone that
 * could read is offered the option. A person also passes a disclosure screen —
 * `app/captures/messages.tsx`, in the app's own words — before Android's
 * dialog is ever raised.
 *
 * Three rules shape everything here:
 *
 *   - Nothing read ever leaves the device. The messages go straight to
 *     `proposeFromSms`, which parses on-device (ADR-013). A bank SMS carries an
 *     account tail, a balance and sometimes a one-time password; the whole
 *     point of parsing locally is that none of that is worth sending anywhere.
 *
 *   - Nothing read is ever persisted, either. A draft made from a *read*
 *     message carries its parsed fields and no `rawText` — see
 *     `lib/smsDrafts.ts`, which is where that is decided and pinned by a test.
 *     A *pasted* message is different: the person put it there themselves, and
 *     it keeps the behaviour every other capture has.
 *
 *   - It can never crash the app. The inbox reader is a native module that does
 *     not exist on iOS, in Expo Go, or in any build that did not include it, so
 *     it is loaded lazily behind a non-throwing check and every failure — no
 *     module, no permission, a read that errors — degrades to a described
 *     result the screen turns into a sentence, never an exception at launch or
 *     at the tap (the native-module rule the other `lib/*` wrappers follow).
 *
 * The logic is split from the wiring: `readSmsInbox` takes every side effect as
 * an injected dependency so all of it is unit-tested without a device, and
 * `readSms` is the thin production entry that supplies the real ones.
