 * to people). Direction lives in the caption ("Owes you" / "You owe") so the right
 * edge is just the coloured amount, and the invite/remind actions shrink to a
 * single round glyph beside it rather than a text pill that padded the row out.
 * A person unsettled in two currencies is one row with both nets stacked.
 *
 * Memoized: it lives in a virtualized list, and a recycled row that lands on the
 * same person with the same selection state does no work when the parent
 * re-renders. Every prop is a primitive or a reference the screen keeps stable
 * (`t` is static per locale, the two handlers are `useCallback`), so the shallow
 * compare holds and a fast fling never re-runs a row it already drew.
