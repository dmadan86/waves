/**
 * Trip budgets: a ceiling somebody set, measured against what the ledger says

 *
 * The same two rules the rest of the trip maths obeys hold here:
 *
 *   * **Currencies never mix (ADR-004).** A budget is a number in one currency.
 *     It is measured against spend in *that* currency and no other — a euro cap
 *     is not "used up" by a rupee dinner. Spend in other currencies is real and
 *     is reported separately; it just does not count against this cap, because
 *     the rate to make it count is one nobody agreed.
 *   * **Minor units and bigint throughout.** No Number touches an amount. The
 *     one place a ratio is taken — for a progress bar's width — is the only
 *     float, and it is a display value, never money.
 *
 * "Spent" is never stored. A member's spend is the sum of their expense shares:
 * what the split says is theirs. That is the number a personal budget is a
 * ceiling on — "how much of this trip is mine to pay for" — not what they
 * happened to front at the counter.
