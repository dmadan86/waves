/**
 * r2-sign — the only door between the app and Cloudflare R2 (A44).
 *
 * The client never holds an R2 credential: a leaked S3 key is the whole bucket.
 * Instead every read, write and delete is brokered here.
 *
 *   put    → authorise, check the storage ceiling, mint a presigned PUT URL.
 *   commit → after the client's PUT lands, HEAD the object for its true size and
 *            record it in the ledger (the real cap boundary; over-cap or
 *            over-size objects are deleted and refused).
 *   get    → authorise a read, then return an R2 presigned GET for objects the
 *            ledger knows, or a Supabase signed URL for anything still on the
 *            old backend (dual-read; "new uploads only" migration).
 *   delete → authorise, remove from R2, release the ledger row.
 *
 * Authorisation mirrors the Supabase Storage RLS the buckets used to carry:
 * group objects need group membership, a group photo needs the paid gate to
 * write, personal objects need to be the owner's, and an avatar is readable by
 * anyone sharing a group with its owner.
 *
 * The request handling lives here as a pure function taking its side-effecting
 * boundaries (the Supabase clients, the R2 client, the object-URL builder) as
 * injected dependencies, so it can be unit-tested without Deno, a network or a
 * real bucket. `index.ts` is the thin `Deno.serve` shell that wires the real
 * implementations in.
