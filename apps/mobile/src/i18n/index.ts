/**
 * i18n from day one (TDR §11): en, ta, hi and now ar, with locale-aware money
 * and date formatting everywhere. Notification copy lives in
 * @waves/core/notifications so the server sends the same words.
 *
 * The phone's own language is the default and always will be. What sits on top
 * of it now is a choice — `LanguageProvider` in `./language` — because the
 * phone is one setting for one person and this app is used by people who read
 * one language and set their phone to another. Somebody in Chennai with an
 * English phone reads Tamil faster than they read English.
 *
 * Arabic is the first right-to-left language here, and it is more than a fourth
 * column of strings — the whole layout mirrors. React Native does that itself
 * when `I18nManager.isRTL` is true, and it decides that once, natively, at
 * launch. `extra.supportsRTL` in app.json is what lets the native side honour
 * it; `./language` is where the restart that a direction change needs is
 * explained rather than hidden.
 *
 * React Native mirrors more than it gets credit for: with
 * `doLeftAndRightSwapInRTL` — true by default — it swaps `left`/`right` in
 * styles, reverses `flexDirection: 'row'` and flips `textAlign`. So the
 * `marginLeft`s and `paddingRight`s scattered through this app are not bugs in
 * an RTL layout, and rewriting them to `marginStart`/`paddingEnd` would change
 * nothing at all.
 *
 * What it cannot mirror is an **icon**, because an icon is content rather than
 * layout. `chevron-forward` keeps pointing right in a screen that now runs the
 * other way, so "next" points backwards. `directionalIcon` in @waves/ui is the
 * fix, and every arrow in the app goes through it.
