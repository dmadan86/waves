/**
 * Speak an expense — one or several, in any language, with an optional new group.
 *
 * Reached from the raised mic. The phone turns speech into text on-device (see
 * VoiceMicPanel). What that text means is worked out by the pure
 * {@link parseVoiceExpenses} heuristic — amounts, currencies, a named group,
 * several expenses in a breath, a spoken "make a group called X", and a
 * "just for me" that routes to the personal ledger — all with no network and no
 * model.
 *
 * Either way the last step is a review, never a blind write: the heard expenses
 * are listed, each editable, with a destination to choose — the capture inbox
 * (unassigned, the default), an existing group, or a new group the sentence
 * asked for. Only then does Save write them.
 *
 * The route imports nothing native directly: the microphone is reached through
 * VoiceMicPanel, which loads the native module inside a try, so an older binary
 * shows a message instead of crashing.
