/**
 * The trip's exchange rates, pinned on the group (ADR-003, extended).
 *
 * A rate should be entered once, not once per bill. An admin pins one number
 * per currency the trip will be paid in — "1 ₹ = ₫312" — and every expense
 * entered in that currency converts with it, for everybody, including the
 * budgets. A bill can still disagree: the rate on an expense wins over the
 * trip's, and what is stored on the expense is the winner, so moving the trip
 * rate next week can never quietly re-price last week's dinner.
 *
 * Two controls live here. `SettlesInRow` is the currency the group counts in —
 * the one thing every balance is expressed in, and so the one thing that cannot
 * be moved once there are entries counted in it. `TripRatesCard` is the list of
 * pinned rates and the sheet that edits one.
 *
 * The editor asks for the rate in whichever direction gives a number bigger
 * than one, because that is the direction people actually hold: 312 dong to the
 * rupee, 91 rupees to the dollar. Which of those it is depends on the pair, so
 * both are offered and either is turned into the single shape storage takes.

 * "1 USD = ⬚ INR" with a text link called "turn it around" beside it.
 *
 * What it replaces was a wall of sixteen chips, a label, a link, a field, a
 * full-width fetch button and a line restating the rate that had just been
 * typed: six controls to enter one number. The currency moved into its own
 * pane, reached by tapping the pill on the card it belongs to, because picking
 * from sixteen currencies is a list with names in it rather than a strip of
 * codes.
 *
 * Two ways to arrive at the number, in the order somebody actually has one:
 * typing what they know, and asking for today's mid-market rate. There is no
 * "what my card charged" here — that is a fact about one payment, and this is
 * the number the whole trip is counted with; the per-bill editor keeps it.
