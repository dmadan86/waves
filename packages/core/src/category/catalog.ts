/**
 * The user's expense-tag catalog — built-ins plus the tags they define
 * themselves (extends TDR §8).
 *
 * A category used to be one of ten fixed built-ins. Now a person can add their
 * own tags (a label, an icon, a colour), and hide or reorder the built-ins. That
 * personal catalog lives in the `category_tags` table (one row per custom tag,
 * plus one override row per built-in the person has hidden or moved). This module
 * turns those rows — together with the fixed `CATEGORIES` — into the single
 * ordered list the pickers and the manager render, and resolves a stored category
 * value (built-in id or custom tag id) to something drawable.
 *
 * Pure and React-free, like the rest of `@waves/core`: the mobile layer supplies
 * the translated built-in labels; everything else is decided here so the picker,
 * the badges and the insights charts agree.
