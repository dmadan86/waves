/**
 * A priority queue for the one-at-a-time prompts that fight over the first-run
 * screen — the coach-mark tour and the daily tip sheet today, more later.
 *
 * The problem it solves: on the very first Home open both the tour and the tip
 * sheet want the screen at once, and stacking a hint on top of a coach-mark is
 * noise. So each overlay claims a slot with a priority while it wants to show,
 * and only the highest-priority live claim is *granted*. When that one releases
 * (the tour finishes), the next in line is granted — after its own delay, so a
 * hint lands a beat after the tour clears rather than the same frame.
 *
 * Kept deliberately small: a claim is just an id and a number, the winner is the
 * live claim with the largest number, and a slot's `granted` is "am I the winner
 * (once my delay has passed)". No timers or ordering live in the provider; the
 * delay is the waiting slot's own concern.
