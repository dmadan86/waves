/**
 * Reading a bank SMS into a *proposed* expense.
 *
 * The interesting tests here are the refusals. A parser that reads a real debit
 * correctly is table stakes; one that reads an OTP as a ₹5,000 dinner, or books
 * a refund as an expense, or re-proposes something already confirmed, produces
 * wrong money in somebody's ledger from a message they never thought about.
 *
 * Every message below is shaped like one an Indian bank actually sends.
