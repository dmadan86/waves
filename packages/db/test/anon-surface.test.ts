/**
 * What a signed-out request can even address.
 *
 * RLS decides which rows come back; these are the grants that decide whether
 * the question can be asked at all. They are asserted as whole sets rather than
 * one table at a time, because the failure this guards against is *addition*: a
 * later migration that creates a function or a table and quietly hands `anon`
 * the default grant. A per-item test would never notice the new thing.
 *
 * The trap is worth stating, since the repo already fell into it once. Supabase
 * ships default privileges on `public` that grant EXECUTE **directly to `anon`**
 * as each function is created, so the familiar
 *
 *     REVOKE ALL ON FUNCTION ... FROM PUBLIC;
 *
 * does not close it — a direct grant is not the PUBLIC one. Every function
 * added after the definer-grant audit was reachable signed-out again for
 * exactly that reason (`20260831120000_anon_surface_hardening`). The house
 * pattern is `FROM PUBLIC, anon`, and this file is what enforces it.
