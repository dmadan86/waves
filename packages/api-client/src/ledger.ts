 * Rows into balances.

 * `packages/core` is forbidden to depend on React or Supabase (TDR §1). If a
 * guest's browser and the payer's phone ever disagreed about who owes what,
 * one of them would be lying to somebody about their money, and there would be
 * no way to say which.
 *
 * What this file does add is the conversion: PostgREST hands back minor units
 * as decimal strings, and they become bigints here rather than anywhere a
 * `Number` could get near them (ADR-003).
