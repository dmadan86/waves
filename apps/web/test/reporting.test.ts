/**
 * That nothing private actually leaves.
 *
 * The scrubber itself is tested in @waves/core, and passing those tests proves
 * only that a pure function works. The question this file asks is the one that
 * matters in production: when the SDK is initialised the way the app
 * initialises it, and a real error is captured, what goes out on the wire?
 *
 * So there is no mocking of `beforeSend` here. Sentry is started with a
 * transport that captures the envelope instead of sending it, an error is
 * thrown with a ledger attached to it, and the bytes are searched for the
 * things that must not be in them. A `beforeSend` wired to the wrong option, or
 * an SDK attaching something the hook does not reach, fails this and passes
 * every unit test — which is exactly what happened the first time this ran.
