/**
 * Rows into balances, in a browser.
 *
 * The risk this covers is not arithmetic — that is @waves/core's, and it is
 * property-tested there. It is the conversion on the way in. PostgREST hands
 * minor units back as decimal strings, and every one of them has to become a
 * bigint before anything touches it. A single `Number()` slipping in would
 * produce balances that look right, agree with themselves, and quietly differ
 * from the app's by a paisa — which is the version of this bug nobody catches.
