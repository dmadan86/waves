/**
 * How many phones one account may hold at once, and which of them still count.
 *
 * The free tier is two devices at a time. "At a time" is the whole difficulty:
 * GoTrue knows about refresh tokens, not about whether the phone in a drawer is
 * ever coming back, so "simultaneous" here means *seen recently*. A device that
 * has not checked in for {@link DEVICE_ACTIVE_WINDOW_DAYS} days stops occupying
 * a slot on its own, which is what keeps a closed phone from locking somebody
 * out of the account they are holding.
 *
 * None of this is enforced on the device — a client that counted its own
 * devices is a client somebody could edit, the same mistake as trusting a row
 * to say who it belongs to (see `readEntitlement`). The numbers are decided by
 * `waves_register_device` in the database; this module is the shared vocabulary
 * both sides speak, and the part worth testing without a phone.

 * The default caps, and only the defaults. As of the device-cap A/B work the

 * `device_cap_plus_ab` experiments, all resolved by `waves_device_cap` and
 * handed back in the registration `status`. These constants are the floor the
 * database itself falls back to, and the value `deviceLimitFor` returns for a
 * caller that has no server status — never the source of truth for the gate,
 * which reads `status.overLimit`. They match the seeded knob defaults so the
