/**
 * One seam for every image the app stores (A44).
 *
 * Historically each uploader called `backend.storage.from(bucket)…` inline.
 * Storage now has two backends — Cloudflare R2 for everything uploaded since the
 * cut-over, Supabase Storage for anything before it — and the client must not
 * care which. Every read, write and delete goes through here.
 *
 * When R2 is switched on (`EXPO_PUBLIC_R2_ENABLED`), writes are brokered by the
 * `r2-sign` edge function: the client holds no R2 credential, so it asks for a
 * presigned PUT, uploads straight to R2, then asks the function to record the
 * object (which is where the free-tier storage ceiling is enforced). Reads ask
 * the same function for a URL and it resolves whichever backend holds the object.
 *
 * With R2 off, this is exactly the old behaviour — a direct Supabase Storage
 * call — so the seam is safe to ship before any R2 secret exists.
