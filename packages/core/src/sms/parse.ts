/**
 * Reading a bank SMS into a proposed expense.
 *
 * DEVIATION, recorded deliberately: TDR §10 lists SMS auto-import as out of
 * scope for v1. This module exists because it was asked for directly. It is
 * additive — nothing else depends on it — and the ledger rules are unchanged: a
 * parsed message is a *proposal*, never an entry.
 *
 * Three things this module will not do, all for the same reason:
 *
 *   - it does not touch the network, and nothing here is called from an edge
 *     function. A bank SMS carries an account tail, a balance, and sometimes a
 *     one-time password; sending it anywhere to be parsed would be a worse
 *     privacy trade than the feature is worth (ADR-013);
 *   - it does not write. `proposeFromSms` returns candidates, and a person
 *     confirms each one;
 *   - it does not guess at a split. Who was there is not in the message.
 *
 * Everything is parsed as digits and assembled into minor units. No float ever
 * exists between the text and the amount (ADR-003).
 *
 * ## Never guess silently
 *
 * Three things in a bank message are genuinely undecidable from the text:
 * `08/05/2026` is two different days, `1.234` is two amounts a thousand apart,
 * and `$` is seven currencies. The rule this file follows everywhere is that
 * such a thing is either settled by an explicit signal — the caller's region,
 * locale or default currency, passed in as {@link SmsParseContext} — or it is
 * decided by one documented fallback *and reported*, in `inferred`, with the
 * confidence lowered to match. A parser that guesses is fine. A parser that
 * guesses and then looks certain puts an expense on the wrong day of a trip.
 *
 * The context is entirely optional and every path works without it. A caller
 * that knows the user's country simply gets a better answer, and Waves knows
 * the user's country.

 *     No locale writes it the other way, so `1.234,56` and `1,234.56` are both
 *     settled outright.
 *   - **one kind, more than once.** `1.234.567` and India's `1,23,456` can only
 *     be grouping; nothing has two decimal points.
 *   - **one separator, fewer than three digits after it.** Grouping is always
 *     in threes, so this is a decimal point.
 *   - **one separator, exactly three digits after it.** The genuinely ambiguous
 *     case — and for almost every currency it is not ambiguous at all, because
 *     a currency with two minor digits cannot have three. So the currency's own
 *     exponent settles it, and `EUR 1.234` reads as one thousand two hundred
 *     and thirty-four rather than as €1.23. Only the three-decimal currencies
 *     (KWD, BHD, OMR, JOD, TND) are left genuinely open; there the caller's
 *     locale decides, and with no locale the fallback is reported as inferred.
 *
 * More fraction digits than the currency has are truncated rather than rounded,
 * which is the old rule kept deliberately: inventing a rounding here would hide
 * a parse that went wrong. A zero-decimal currency therefore never acquires
 * phantom minor units — `JPY 1,234.00` is ¥1,234, not ¥123,400.
