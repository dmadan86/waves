/**
 * Review: what the app already found, never a field to fill.
 *
 * This is the bar's "Review" tab and the one true drafts hub (A34,
 * `docs/plan-drafts-and-rules.md`) — every spend caught before it had a group,
 * whatever brought it in: typed, spoken, photographed, or read out of the
 * phone's own bank messages. It used to open on a list under day headings with
 * a chat glyph in the corner leading to a paste box. On a phone that has
 * already granted permission to read those messages, sending somebody to
 * Messages to select, copy, come back and paste is the app refusing to do its
 * job — so the paste box is no longer the shape of this screen. It is the
 * fallback it always was, reachable from the header glyph on a phone that
 * cannot read, and from the zero state — and the primary path only where there
 * is no other: iPhone, where no reading API exists at any tier. It has no
 * footer under the list: a button sitting below a hundred and forty drafts is
 * one nobody scrolls to, and on a phone that *does* read, an alternative way in
 * is not something to advertise at all.
 *
 * FOUR THINGS CHANGED, AND EACH ANSWERS A COMPLAINT.
 *
 * 1. **A status, not an instruction.** The top of the screen used to explain
 *    what to do. An instruction is what you show somebody you are about to make
 *    work; when the app is doing the work, the honest object is a *state*. So:
 *    a dot and "Watching your bank messages · 2 min ago", read in two seconds,
 *    tappable to look again. It is shown only while something really is
 *    watching (`useSmsAutoRead`), because a line claiming to watch when nothing
 *    does would be worse than no line at all. It now rides on the same gradient
 *    hero a group opens with (`components/ScreenHero`) — one of the three
 *    screens in the bottom bar should not announce itself with the small-glyph
 *    row of a settings page — over the count of what is still waiting and the
 *    button that adds to it.
 *
 * 2. **Two errands in tabs, two confidences in sections.** The tabs are *where
 *    a draft came from*: **SMS** — read off the phone's inbox, or pasted in on
 *    an iPhone, which is still a bank message — and what this person added on
 *    purpose. Inside whichever tab is open, the list is cut again into
 *    **Ready** and **Worth a look** — a split by what the parser is *sure of*.
 *    Two questions, asked at different moments, and `lib/reviewFeed.ts` carries
 *    both rules and the reasoning; the sections stay sections because they need
 *    no navigation, carry their own counts, and disappear when empty. The
 *    screen opens on the tab that can reach zero, which is the added one.
 *
 * 3. **One gesture, not one screen.** Most rows should need a single swipe.
 *    Toward the leading edge files the draft where that shop's money went last
 *    time — and the row's chip already *says* where that is, so the gesture
 *    confirms something visible rather than doing something hidden. The other
 *    way means **not an expense**: a credit-card bill, a transfer to yourself,
 *    rent nobody splits. That second one is what earns the feature its keep; an
 *    inbox you can only add from fills with noise and gets abandoned. Tapping
 *    still opens the full editor, and both gestures are also plain rows in the
 *    ⋯ sheet — a swipe is never the only way through (`components/SwipeRow`).
 *    And "Select" turns on tick boxes so that second answer can be given once
 *    about many: a morning's bank messages is thirty rows and most of them are
 *    a card bill or a transfer to yourself, so saying "not an expense" thirty
 *    times is not answering, it is data entry.
 *
 * 4. **The zero state is the point.** Review is trying to reach zero: it is the
 *    app's list of questions, and a good week is one where it has none. So the
 *    empty screen says "Nothing needs you" and then says how much went through
 *    anyway (`data/reviewSources.ts`), rather than apologising for being empty.
 *
 * WHAT DID NOT CHANGE. Expenses spoken in one breath still fold into one
 * collapsible card whose ⋯ can place the whole cluster at once — a batch is one
 * outing and gets one answer, which is why it keeps the sheet rather than a
 * swipe of its own. Everything is still personal and offline-first: a row still
 * queued wears a faint cloud glyph rather than hiding until the server has seen
 * it (ADR-005), and the destination chip is derived from the local ledger
 * mirror, so it is right with no network. A draft made from a message the app
 * *read* still carries no message body at all; that rule lives in
 * `lib/smsDrafts.ts` and this screen never goes near a body.

          messages screen uses — the two screens ask the same question of the
          same kind of pile, and answering it differently in each would make a
          person learn it twice.

          Both buttons hand the ticked rows to machinery that already existed
          for a spoken batch: one destination for several drafts, everybody in,
          split equally. Nothing new decides anything here. */}

        /* It rises rather than appearing. The bar takes the navigation's place
           the instant a row is ticked, and a panel that simply *is* there reads
           as a redraw — something went wrong and the screen repainted — where
           one that slides up from the edge reads as an answer to the tap. Out
           the same way, so the navigation coming back is a handover rather than
           a flicker. Off entirely when the phone asks for less motion — `sel`
           jumps rather than eases then.

           Mounted whenever this tab is the ticking one, shown by animating
           `sel`, rather than mounted when something is ticked and animated in
           and out by `entering`/`exiting`. The difference matters here and is
           not a matter of taste:

           This screen is a tab, and the navigator freezes a blurred tab's
           rendering (`(tabs)/_layout.tsx`). A layout animation is driven by
           mount and unmount, and going away while the bar was up ran its
           `exiting` — after which coming back did not bring it back. Two drafts
           ticked, out to the voice screen and straight back, and the bar was
           gone with the selection still live and its own buttons unreachable:
           the ticks were there, "2 selected" was there, and the only way to act
           on them was to clear the selection and tick them again.

           An always-mounted view driven by a shared value has no such state to
           lose — it is the same crossfade the panel above already uses for the
           same gesture, and the reason that one survived the same trip. */
