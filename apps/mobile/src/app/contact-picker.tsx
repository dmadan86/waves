/**
 * The full-screen contact picker.
 *
 * Adding people to a group used to open the address book inline — a tall list
 * folded into the middle of the new-group and members forms. A thousand-name
 * book needs the whole screen (the alphabet rail needs somewhere to aim), so it
 * lives here as its own route now, and the form that wanted it navigates in.
 *
 * A pushed route cannot return a value the way an inline callback did, so the
 * caller leaves its intent in `contactPickerBridge` first — who is already
 * picked, and what to do with the answer — and this screen reads it once on
 * open. Confirming hands the ticked people back through that callback and
 * closes; backing out without confirming drops the request untouched.
