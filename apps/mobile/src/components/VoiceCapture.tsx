 * adding to a note, but capturing a single utterance and returning it, so the
 * screen can parse it into an expense.
 *

          already says what was missed, so the mic just invites the tap — no
          second warning under it. At rest: a worked example under the prompt.
          The miss is stated once (the title), never a warning stacked on a
          warning. */}

        {/* The line that says "Tap to speak" is a thing to tap. It was copy and
            nothing else, which meant the most literal reading of the screen —
            tap the words telling you to tap — did nothing at all. It runs the
            same `toggle` the mic runs, so it can never drift out of step with
            it: whatever the mic would do in this state, this does.

            Deliberately not a second entry in the accessibility tree. The mic
            two rows up is already a button carrying this exact label — the same
            expression, character for character — and this exact action, so a
            screen reader that meets the same command twice in a row has learned
            nothing the second time. This is that control's own copy, widened
            into a target for the eye and the thumb.

            It takes all three props, and `accessible={false}` is the one doing
            the work on iOS. A `Pressable` defaults to `accessible`, which makes
            it an accessibility *element* — and `accessibilityElementsHidden`
            hides what an element contains, not the element itself, so on its own
            it would have left VoiceOver announcing this button after the mic's.
            (Everywhere else in the app this pair sits on a plain `View`, which
            is not an element, which is why two props are enough there.)
            `importantForAccessibility` is the Android half. */}

          English model is not installed) or it is the way out of a miss the
          network engine caused — when that recogniser hears audio and returns
          nothing, it is broken on this device and the on-device model is the only
          path that works.

          `marginTop: 'auto'` is what carries it down: the panel grows to the
          window, so the free space collects above this block instead of below it.
          The padding above is its own breathing room, and the room below it comes
          from the route's `clearance` — the system navigation bar's inset plus a
          breath — applied once, on the scroll container. */}
