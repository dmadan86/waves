/**
 * The wording of the activity feed.
 *
 * This exists because the feed drifted once already: two screens each carried
 * their own copy of this logic, one was fixed and the other was not, and the
 * group tab went on rendering "Ravi superseded expense_version" — a table name
 * shown to somebody whose edit had just been thrown away. There is now one
 * function, and these tests are what keeps it one.
 *
 * The cases worth pinning are the ones where a plausible-looking line tells
 * the reader something untrue or useless: an unattributed action, somebody
 * else's name on your own action, and the sync-conflict entry.
