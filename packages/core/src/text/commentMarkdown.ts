/**
 * Sanitising and normalising the Markdown a comment carries.
 *
 * Expense comments are stored as Markdown, but only a deliberately tiny subset
 * is ever meaningful — bold, italic, strikethrough and bullet lists (see
 * `CommentMarkdown`). Everything the renderer does not understand renders as
 * literal text, so the render side is inherently safe. This module is the write
 * side of that contract: whatever a client sends is normalised down to the same
 * subset before it leaves the device, so the stored value never carries anything
 * the renderer would have to be trusted to ignore.
 *
 * Comments are text only — no images, ever (ADR-046 keeps comment bytes off R2).
 * Image Markdown is therefore stripped here as well as never offered in the UI.
 *
 * React Native renders through `<Text>`, which has no DOM and executes no HTML,
 * so a `<script>` in a comment is only ever the five literal characters. The
 * sanitiser still strips HTML-shaped tags so the *stored* value stays clean for
 * any future reader.
 *
 * That future reader now exists, which is why this lives in core rather than in
 * the phone: the web renders the same bodies. **The web's safety does not come
 * from this file.** A body written before this sanitiser existed, or by a client
 * that never ran it, is still whatever it is — so the browser renderer builds
 * React elements and never sets HTML, which makes a `<script>` in a stored body
 * five literal characters there too. This module keeps what is *written* clean;
 * the renderer is what keeps what is *read* safe.
