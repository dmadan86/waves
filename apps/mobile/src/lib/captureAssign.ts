/**
 * Where a capture goes when it is assigned to a group: the add-expense form,
 * prefilled from the capture and carrying its id so saving there closes the
 * capture (useAssignCapture) rather than leaving a duplicate behind.
 *
 * One place builds this href so the two callers that assign — the inbox's group
 * picker and the "New group" flow that creates a group then drops the capture
 * into it — hand the form exactly the same params. The caller chooses how to
 * navigate: the picker pushes (back returns to the inbox), the new-group flow
 * replaces (back must not return to the half-made group screen).
